      "['I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!<br /><br />I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend. I had more than 4 cups of coffee before I noticed on the packaging that it said House Blend instead of Kona Blend. I would not have known that it was not the Kona Blend had I not seen the packaging. One caveat: I make \"lattes\" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.  Someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />My bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the Kona Blend, due to vendor and shipping costs, and it is more than good enough for me.  I\\'ve since ordered another box.', 'I don\\'t typically like banana flavored stuff. I\\'m not that crazy about adding bananas in my shakes. But this banana cookie bar is FREAKIN AWESOME. It is so delicious. I share them with friends all the time and the only friend that didn\\'t like it just had a thing about not liking dates (and the ONLY three ingredients in this bar-o-goodness are: almonds, dates, and unsweetened bananas). THANK YOU LARA FOR YOUR DELICIOUSNESS IN A BAR. Just as tasty as it is nutritious ... and THAT is somewhat difficulat to find in \"ready to eat\" foods.', 'This food is the best.  Our golden retriever who is prone to all sorts of allergies is scratch free with this food.  Thanks Amazon for making it so easy to order online.', 'Purchase this olive oil for all the great flavors it came with, enjoy cooking with them and using them in salads. Would recommend this brand.', \"These are better than any I have ever purchased in Whole Foods, Fresh Market, or any place!  The price is outstanding and can't be beat.  I can't wait to make some cranberry bread out of these!<br /><br />One of my favorite ways to eat them is to mix them with walnuts and a few chocolate chips.  (dark chocolate of course)<br />It satisfies my sweet tooth and a healthy snack, to boot.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to trying the cherries when these are gone!  I would have bought cherries first but didn't see them until I had already ordered these.  I'm not disappointed!<br />I hope the price stays the same!\", \"Although this is of the more viscous kind, it smells good and has a nice sweet taste. I have been using it as a sugar substitute and it has worked very well. It's a bit pricey compared to all the other commercial, processed honey available, but well worth it. Buy the 2 pack, you won't regret it.\", \"I have 7 cats, ranging in age from 15 years, down to 2 years & they ALL LOVE THIS!  I used to feed them another brand of food (they're all indoor cats) & when I introduced them to this food, they couldn't get enough of it!  They've been eating this food EXCLUSIVELY for at LEAST 7 years now (obviously, the younger ones have been eating it for less time) & NONE of them has EVER been sick from it!\", \"I've bought them many times. Good quality and good taste, baby love it, and I love it too. Reccommend it.\", \"As a pet enthusiast, I appreciate when a manufacturer cares about the animal and not just the profits.  First Mate has their own factory and sources their products from North America. They formulate their food to be holistic, basically, what the dog needs and nothing else.  Their food is balanced and not trendy like many of the high protein diets.  Best of all...my dogs eat it!  I cannot tell you how many times I have purchased high end foods that my dogs won't go near.\", 'This was my first jug and I will re-order. It is a bit thinner than other brands I\\'ve tried, but more \"maply\" in taste. I did use Wholefoods 365 - their own brand -- which is a blend on syrups from \"the US and Canada.\"', 'I love this tea! It has a great flavor (slightly floral and even a little bit sweet). I think it is much better than other green teas. The srrength of the tea brewed through the Keurig is perfect, too. I highly recommend it.', 'When I was diagnosed with celiac disease I stopped eating bread because it tasted so bad.  My friend Lois shared the bread with me and it tasted like real bread and it was soft.  At first they were out of pamelas and I tried a different brand but it wasnt so good.  I started getting it every 2 months but Iate it so quickly I get it every month.  I am anxiously waiting for the shipment to come because I am out of the bread.', 'Great standing prime rib. meat was well pakaged and fresh. Meat was delivered early. Prime rib was so juicy...followed this recipe from paula deen, yummy...[....] Thanks so much', \"I didn't believe the hype I had heard about cacao beans until I bought them.<br />How good they taste is a subjective question , I think they taste great. Someone who is very picky may argue they are bitter (not this brand - ALL cacao beans, by nature).  Those people who would deny the health benefits of these because of a mild bitter taste on your tongue for 20 seconds, is better off with a bag of M&M's anyway.<br />For anyone else who eats smaller quantities of food to maintain your physique, or are on a diet etc - your really going to like these a lot. When you are ready for proof they work, try the following experiment: eat about 5 of these an hour before your usual workout. compare your performance with, and without these in your system. Then you'll know what the hype is all about.\", 'I have been a tea drinker for over 40 years.  This is the best Chai that I have every had.  Even made with water it is flavorful.', 'This is the best lemon cookie that I have ever tasted.  I bought a box at a Ross store and then never saw the product again.  I went on to Amazon and bought a case three weeks ago.  Between my friends and I they are gone.<br />I am going to buy another case.', \"These cookies have been a special find for me since I have a problem with sugar in addition to being gluten intolerant.  The reviews range from love to hate and I would not base my purchase on them unless they were all bad but it is interesting to see the range on something I've really enjoyed and am so grateful for, being a sweets addict.  I try to keep it down to one cookie at a time but sometimes I can't resist a second one.  I think they are delicious.\", \"My husband and I have been addicted to this coffee since we first started buying it directly from the company several years ago. We love the smell, the caffeine kick and the taste. Sadly, I don't care about fair trade or organic much, but I love this coffee. We introduced it to my brother who is equally picky about coffee and he is addicted to it now. Whenever we eat out for breakfast or have coffee somewhere else, we wish we were at home drinking our coffee. Our friends all love coming over for it as well.\", \"Having been familiar with Dilmah's bagged and branded teas, I tried this one and I was not disappointed.  This is a nice full-bodied tea with a slight malty taste, not unlike a good Irish Breakfast tea.  I brew it in a IngenuiTEA maker for a perfect cup.\", \"My dogs' absolutely loves these. -And I love the fact that they are not Rawhide, but still last them a while.  They are pricey, though--so always wait until they are on sale.\", \"I have to say I was a little apprehensive to buy this product for the price, but I like to keep my K-Cup price under $0.50 and Sam's Club was sold out at the time, and I tried this.  The Fuhgeddaboudit is very strong, but that's how I like it.  Overall, I was impressed.\", \"I love this salt.  You can add it to Bragg's organic apple cider vinegar, and it will taste great.  Plus the fact that it usually cures any sickness I have quickly.  What more can I ask for.\", \"I used to eat Skittles all the time when I was 13-ish.  I had some the other day, the first time I've had Skittles in ages.  I had forgotten how good they are.  All of the flavors are great.  My personal favorite is green.<br /><br />I recommend this popular candy.\", 'My son and I love this bread. It even tastes better than the regular raising bread in the supermarket. It is worth the extra price.', \"I love this tea chest! I was drawn to it thinking it would be a great way to impress guests.  I always love when you're at a restaurant and they present your tea options in this way. Well not only did my guests love it but I love using it on my own. It makes me feel special! (which I realize sounds a little ridiculous but oh well.)<br /><br />The dark wood is beautiful and the inside is lined with green felt. This would make a great gift for any tea lover.\", 'Our \"sled dog\" buddy thinks these are the best so is always on he is best behaviour when he thinks these treats may be in his future', 'BEST SNAPPLE FLAVOR EVER MADE! I was excited when I found this on amazon since I cant find them in stores anymore! I TASTE LIKE I AM TAKING A BITE OUT OF AN ACTUAL JUICY APPLE! AMAZING!', \"This is exactly as described: delicious maple sugar, at the best price I could find anywhere.  While I abandoned my original plan for this as impractical (I wanted to attempt to make some maple rock candy), we've been enjoying this sweetener in our coffee, on our cereal, to make tasty maple kettle-corn, and with other treats.  And it's absolutely delicious as a sweetener for yerba mate (a South American herbal tea of which I'm especially fond).\", 'My 2 cats, age 14 and 15, looked at this food like, \"Where\\'s the GOOD food!\". They had been eating Fancy Feast with gravy which is fine but contains corn and they throw up alot. They have been trowing up about 90% less on Natural Balance. They each put on about 1/2 to 1 pound. Their coats are glossy and I feel better knowing this food is alot healthier. At first, I bought some cheap tuna and had to mix the canned on a 1:1 ratio to get them to eat it, then 1:2, now 1:3 (1 can tuna to 3 cans Natural balance). I will soon wean then off the tuna but there was crying for a few days at first and my 15 year old flat out refused to eat for abot 4 days and lost a pound but finally started to nibble on it and now eats it well. The dry was better received but they need canned also. Worth the bother as now they cry when their dish is empty!!', \"I just love this supplement. It gives me tons and tons of energy, my stool is nice and soft (not too soft). I take it every day and I think it does the job perfectly. I used to not have enough energy in the morning, even after drinking coffee. But since I've been taking Natural Calm in the morning and in the afternoon I am full of energy. Even after I have lunch, I don't crush like before. I keep on going and working without problems of being tired. I just love it!!!\", \"My mom-in-law had rec'd 1 box of these in a gift box, but couldn't find more when she found she enjoyed the convenience of them in her hot tea & on toast.  She said the straws are just the right amount, they are less messy & the honey keeps longers than in a jar.  A 6-pk was a great surprise for her.  The price was reasonable for a convenience item.\", 'I enjoy the premasured packs and I am sending some to our soldiers as they find the packs better to serve them.', 'The wild rice and brown rice medley are flavorful and beautiful colors.  They have an interesting texture and look nice with other foods.  They have concise but complete cooking instructions.  All in all, a real treat.', 'I had to stop giving my  15 year old cat dry food because he could no longer hold it down (even the ones with only whole food ingredients were too hard on his system).  He would even throw up blood clots if I had to leave him with dry food for a couple of days.  His stool became loose and smelled even worse than usual.  I gave him this on a trip that I had to bring him along with me and he has been doing great on it. His stool is hard now and he holds it down.', 'The flavor of this product is great. It is not HOT as one might assume cajun products are.  Thanks for a great product.', 'I received my order (van hotte flavored coffee) quickly and it was described accurately.  Thank you  Karen Van Den Berge', 'After reading all the positive raves about these products, I decided to give them a try. Having fresh lemons and limes isn\\'t always possible and these are excellent substitutes. I like them so much that I\\'ll need to invest in the large shaker size for home use and save the packets for carrying in my purse. I\\'ve added these to water and various teas (both hot and cold) and for cooking. I really like the lemon sprinkled on fish. I haven\\'t tried the grapefruit but I plan to buy some soon. I don\\'t seem to tolerate acesulfame potassium and sucralose very well, so I\\'ve stayed away from the True Lemonade drinks.<br />The taste of the lemon, lime, and the orange are very subtle to whatever you add them to, they truly enhance everything. They don\\'t overpower the taste like some flavorings do.<br /><br />What I found surprising is that one of the product claims on their website is that these are sugar free, yet \"cane juice\" is listed last in the ingredients on each packet. I guess that\\'s what they mean by \"no artificial sweetners\".', \"With so many different GF cookies out there, it is getting harder and harder to find a cookie that isn't just full of sugar. Eat these suckers with some water and you are set for the day!\", 'Was given a recipe by a coworker that required Hawaiian Sea Salt.  The recipe came out perfect after using this product.  Well made and well packaged.  Would recommend.', \"A normal, off the shelf pasta has about 220 calories per 2oz (dry, uncooked) serving.  Very few people actually eat JUST 2 ounces -- this is why pasta has gotten such a bad reputation in the quest to loose weight or maintain a healthy weight.  The wheat provides a small amount of protein, but unless you're eating whole wheat pasta (ik) it doesn't provide fiber.<br /><br />Enter Fiber Gourmet products!  That same 2oz dry serving has only 130 calories, plus it also has 18 (can you believe it?) grams of fiber.  And it isn't grainy like whole wheat pasta, or slimy like some of the low-carb things that hit the market a few years ago with the Adkins craze.  In fact, it tastes just like regular pasta.<br /><br />And they make it in several of the most popular shapes.  And if you go to the Fiber Gourmet site, they also make it in several popular flavors -- my favorites are the red/black pepper, the cajun, and the garlic/parsley.  They evidently also make tomato, but have been out of it every time I've gone looking.<br /><br />It's really good stuff.  :D  Hard to argue with 130 calories and 18g of fiber, now matter what kind of sauce or pesto you put on it!\", \"I've tried so many different teas wanting to take the healthy approach but have been shoved right back to the coffee pot due to complete lack of flavor. Tea always seemed so boring. However, this tea is so yummy I am converted. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy coffee, but I now incorporate this tea almost daily. I love the Chamomile Citrus and Green tea Tropical!! The smell is divine and the tea bags are practically a work of art... LOVES IT!!\", 'A friend gave me this herbal tea for Christmas & I was hooked immediately! It has enough natural sweetness that it does not need any sweetner added to it. I took a few packs of it to Miami to visit my son & his family & they also loved it! My daughter-in-law found it on Amazon & ordered it for her & me ! I really do drink a cup every morning! Great product & thanks to Amazon a great price!One tip for ordering: make sure you order correctly! There is a caffeine free herbal & another w/ real tea & caffeine. We accidently ordered the one w/ caffeine the first time.', 'My husband bought me a Keurig coffee maker for my birthday. I really shopped around for the lowest prices on k-cups. Amazon was the cheapest. Green Mountain coffee is one of our favorites. So we are very happy with our purchase at Amazon.', \"I love these bars and run out of them quickly. I don't feel guilty about this snack - they are tasty yet healthy.\", 'It is all about the right mixture and the better way to brew a nice cup of coffee. We add lots of hot milk to it and make out own latte. This coffee is our espresso replacement and tastes so good! It is a coffee our European visitors really appreciate.<br />There are 2 reasons to prefer it over Starbucks, it is heck of a lot cheaper and it tastes at least as good (to me).', 'Our son likes this meal, but it is definitely something that needs to be warmed.  When it is cool or at room temperature the consistency is a little unappealing.', 'My Dog takes a few different medications, and it has been a struggle to get her to take her pills.  I have tried everything from cheese, hot dogs, etc., etc.  Thank-you Greenies for coming up with such a wonderful way for a pet to take their medication.  My dog thinks it\\'s a treat, and has \"no idea\", she is taking medication!', \"I have been trying out different crackers and pretzels to fulfill my need for something nonsweet and crunchy that isn't too bad for me.  I think Manischewitz has a real shot at the non-bube market. Even though there is no salt added, these whole wheat matzos aren't tasteless.  I think they would sell more boxes to outsiders if they shrank the image of the crackers on the box and included a simple hummus recipe on the back of the box as a serving suggestion.  It couldn't hurt.\", 'So far, I\\'ve only used this in banana bread. And I cut it with some regular flour in probably a 70% spelt to 30% flour ratio. My next batch I will use all spelt to see what happens. My boyfriend and I call the spelty banana bread \"Run-der Bread\" because when we eat it before going on a run, we have a lot of energy.', 'This has been the only thing to rival chicken treats. Both my dogs smell the salmon when the bag is open & are at there best behavior. Prompt delivery! Excellent service. Saved my figurative bacon!', \"you'll eat this bacon and weep because you'll realize what you've been missing all these years ... nueske's bacon tastes as different (and as better) as good tuna sushi does to the canned stuff.<br /><br />butt-expensive, yes, but worth every penny ... the hillcrest farm, where nueske's is made, is so hardcore that they consider the f.d.a. guidelines for bacon too lax, so they abide by their own standards.<br /><br />makes a super-great present for any gourmand, gourmet, epicure, or carb-free diet head.<br /><br />nueske's also makes a pepper bacon, and this one is *much* better.  make sure to follow their cooking instructions to the letter (expect almost no shrinkage) and you will be set.<br /><br />keep an eye on the nueske's web site, they sometimes have sales and discounts.\", 'I have been drinking Mate for years and this is my favorite brand. It is almost \"soul cleansing.\"<br /><br />The taste is one that takes getting used to.<br /><br />I drink mine with honey.', \"If you make bread at home, you've noticed that some loaves don't hold their shape very well.  Vital Wheat Gluten solves that problem.  Use one teaspoon per cup of all purpose flour, and your bread will hold its shape better during rising and baking.  No other changes to the recipe are required.  This product does not alter the flavor of the bread in any way.  I make bread every day, and am much happier with my results wince I've begun using gluten powder in it.\", \"I am happy that I am able to get this item through Amazon.com since they no longer sell it in any of the stores.  The dispenser is not very good as others have mentioned, so I just pop off the red cap on top and take them out that way so I don't lose any to crushing in the faulty dispenser.  I just received my order today, (6 bags of 6).  I was happy that I got them so fast, although one bag of six only had five in it.  Hopefully this is a one time mistake, so I am still giving 5 stars.\", \"This brazil nut butter is better than I thought it was going to be! I personally am not a brazil nut fan, but I do love this product!! It could be added to fruit or something elese that's sweet, or it would taste good spread on bread, or even great on it's own. It doesn't have a boring taste. I recomend it.\", 'The package arrived in prior to reported delivery date!!! I just wish it was in a resealable bag. I would buy from them again even without that small issue', 'This is a 2 fold product and you must be aware of this. It is great at making me drowsy before bedtime but it is also a stool softener! So...you need to experiment with how much you need/can take comfortably. I call it my cheese to magnesium ratio! It is a great product and I use it a lot...just with care. One rounded teaspoon in very warm water before bed seems to be \" my level\". Great product and service.', \"I tired this product for the first time & have tried several others over the yrs. I found this one to be very nice in both flavor & texture. It blends well & doesn't have the chalky taste many others have. I tried it w/ just water & it was okay & tried it w/ lowfat greek yogart & also w/ some fresh fruit blended in to make it more as a smoothie. I work 12 hrs shifts & sometimes having this as a meal replacement works well rather than a lot of snacks with  meal while working or for the grab & go breakfast @ 4am (mixed the night before & chilled overnight & put in water bottle). I tied the strawberry flavor & will try others as i go along. ***HINT drink very chilled for best results.\", \"I just finished an 8 pack I ordered and just wanted to say this is the best jerky on the market.

I don't dig Genoa or any wimpy greasy stuff.<br /><br />This stuff is hard, hearty, and really well spiced up.<br /><br />Cooked or cold, it kicks ass.<br /><br />I would bring this on a boat, camping, or to the workplace.<br /><br />Sliced nice, it would really compliment cheese, crackers, and vino too.<br /><br />No doubt, one serious real deal of value.\", 'These KIND bars are the best bars I have ever had.<br />I received them promptly and they were very fresh<br />I plan to try other varities by this manufactuer', \"These treats are my picky cat's favorite.  I've tried about 8 different brands in the past and these are always the preferred kind.  Highly recommended!\", \"Great way to keep Splenda on hand even when traveling internationally.  You pay extra for the packaging, but the packaging is what counts when you're on travel.\", 'This 100% natural product for cats and dogs going through stressful times includes the same active ingredients as those for the relief of tension in some natural human formulas, like valerian and chamomile, and also apparently has a good taste, as a dropper full of the liquid in food is devoured with relish; it also includes passion flower and fructose, which is probably why it has a sweet aroma, and adds to the palatability. Other ingredients are hops, scull cap, and inert ingredients include deionized water and sodium benzoate.<br /><br />I\\'ve found it very useful on two occasions, once when trying to catch a young feral kitty, and secondly, to relieve the anxiety of my devoted eight year old Liddy when introducing the young cat into the household. Also good for pets that are nervous travelers, and those few animals that get upset when being groomed.<br /><br />Richard\\'s Organics Pet Calm claims that it \"Treats short-term stress\", and in my situations, it has worked beautifully. Depending on the size of the dog or cat (1 dropper = 1 ml. / Up to 40 lbs., 1-4 ml. / Over 40 lbs., 3-6 ml.), there are a lot of doses in this 2 oz. bottle, and I think it\\'s an excellent value.<br /><br />Liddy, Maggie and I are very satisfied customers of this product, which has made our lives easier and more peaceful.', 'These coffee beans are rich, full-bodied, and economical.  This is the second time I have ordered them, and both times, was pleased with the flavor.  I had to cut back some on the amount I used, because the coffee was almost too strong, even though I like strong coffee.  There was no bitterness or after-taste.  I highly recommend this product.', \"These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.

But, at 150 calories and 89 cents per serving on Amazon subscribe & save, this is not too much of a bargain. For the occasional cup of cocoa this fits the bill, but if you have children around who like to drink a lot of cocoa and invite their friends over for it, this can get pricey. Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa on the other hand is only 60 calories and 54 cents per serving.', 'These are great, way better than a Snickers and healthier.

The bag is 5 ounces and 3.5 servings, each twisted stick is approx 4.5'' long and 5 of them are only 130 calories and just 10 grams of sugar. There is also 2g of protein and 2g of fiber go figure.

However, these cookies are just so delicious that I cannot put them down! I love how the frosting is not just sugar, but also has a butter cream vanilla taste. It tastes like cake. The sprinkles add just the right amount of crunchiness before you bite into the entire cookie. As you chew, the cookie turns into a mouth watering sweet buttery cake dough. This is why I need to watch myself and count the cookies as I eat, to prevent over eating! Though they all taste the same, I am personally more attracted to the pink ones =) So glad I can get these cookies at Wal-mart!<br />I do not recommend buying this online, just because when it gets hot, the cookies tend to stick together.

It is a rare treat to enjoy once again, and the price seemed reasonable enough. With only me to enjoy them, the six boxes had better last a year or two.', 'These are good, but the noodles are not much different than cheap Maruchen Ramen.

I think they are shipped 1 day delivery, but if it is hot, the chocolates may arrive slightly deformed.  This did not detract from the taste.

I sure hope they don't eliminate this flavor or these dessert gums because they are great.<br />I suggest you try the other flavors too: key lime pie, strawberry shortcake, orange creme, etc. I have never seen the rainbow sherbet around here or the root beer float, but I just bought the root beer here on Amazon to try and will write a review after trying it.<br />Oh, and if you are an aunt it is your obligation and duty to always carry gum for your nieces and nephews.\", 'My husband loves these noodles.

It is pricey but if you are able to taste the difference in water taste this will put a smile on your face and a smile from your body as you drink it. Volvic comes from france with a perfect balance of mineral flavors. I have difficulty drinking straight water as most bottled water has no taste and is just wet like poland spring. I can drink volumes of volvic water easily due to the great refreshing taste. I cannot do that with tasteless water like poland spring and fiji waters. Fiji is also expensive but it is just a fancy bottle with tasteless water. Cost does not guarantee quality taste. If you have never experienced the taste of a good water you will if you try this. Always chill volvic for best results before drinking in the bottle it came in. Addition of ice not originated from volvic may alter the taste. The flavor of good water comes from the mineral content and volvic has a perfect blend. Enjoy<br />P.s.

The dino eggs are actually pretty cool... they\\'re basically little pellets of sugar that dissolve when you stir in the hot water.  The outer sugar shell dissolves and what is left behind are these little colorful dino shapes.  There are probably about a dozen or so green, red and orange \"friends\" in each packet.<br /><br />Be aware, though, that you are paying a premium for these little dino eggs.

It can be difficult to find single origin chocolate, but they have several options.  The processing is just right, the darks are dark and rich, not too sweet or bitter, and not overly filled with waxes and cocoa butter the way many others are.  The natural profiles of the chocolate shine through, gently supported by the minimal addition of sugar and vanilla.  My favorite is the Dos Rios, it's fruity with just a little spice, but earthy enough without being dirty or musky.  Because the chocolate is so rich I eat it very slowly--half a square is plenty in one sitting, and I usually only want it once or twice a week.  A bar is worth every cent, even when I find myself giving much of it away (because really, you have to try this...)\", 'Use all flavors to flavor food without calories and sugar.

Personally, I think it tastes better then real coffee! I encourage you to give it a try as I do by brewing it in a 1:1 ratio (1 tbs teeccino to 1 tbs coffee = for 2 cups).

I'd give it 4 stars, because I think the price is a bit steep.  At close to $4.00 per 4 ounce bag it's nearly as expensive as beef jerky I buy for myself.

And now we have something that can be sprinkled over greek-style non-fat plain yogurt, which he IS supposed to be eating more of.

I'm not on a gluten-free diet, but I have friends who are, and this product would be just fine for them. The mix of whole grains has an interesting texture and taste, and the whole blend tastes so good I'd warn you not to sit down with the whole bag in front of the TV. It WILL be gone before you know it.<br /><br />Cost is my only problem with this product, but not because it's not worth the money. Healthy food costs more than junk, as it should, and it's clear to me that Kind is very healthy indeed. We're on low fixed income, though, so this would have to be an occasional splurge item for us, used more as a condiment on aforementioned yogurt than as a complete meal.

The due date (time it should be used up) was about 2 and a half months from time I received it.  (So plan on using this product fairly often.)  Now, as to analysis, I don't have to eat wheat free, gluten free food, so my bias here is toward taste and nutrition.  As to taste, I tried it in my sourdough waffles that I make, substituting the flour for the usual wheat flour and leavening agents (my original recipe called for baking soda, salt, and baking powder--apparently all are in this product), and the waffles turned out just as good if not better than the wheat ones.  I also tried it in the chocolate chip cookie recipe on the package, and I like those cookies better than the original wheat one. The taste is slightly different (I'm sorry, I can't quite put my finger on the difference.)  The cookies tend to be a little more moist and slightly thicker. I plan on trying more of the recipes on the back (there are at least 6 recipes on the back of the package). Nutrition wise, it's a mixed bag; you can't directly compare wheat flour to this mix as the mix has a lot of our minor things like salt which taint the analysis.  Calorie wise, it looks like the mix has more calories (but not a large difference).  To sum up, I really like the product for taste.  If you HAVE to have a gluten free product, I think it is a great alternative.\", \"Meow Mix original is THE ONLY DRY CAT FOOD my kitties will eat, ever! I've made the mistake of picking up the wrong flavor and would end up having to go back to the store and buy the original.  I do mix the wrong one with the original but the portions have to be tons more original than different flavor. My kitties are filled out well, their coats are so heavenly soft and shiny.

They were great for my now 18 month old when he was first starting to eat solid foods... convenient I could throw a pack in my purse, he could easily eat them without making amess (one of the few foods he could eat without making a mess).. my 3YO loves them too... teachers at day care were even asking where we get them.

You may have to have two cups before it begins to work. However, make sure you do not have any place to go when you are trying it out for the first time.  Believe me it will work. Some people it takes time others it works right away. I use it once a day and it keeps me regular. It dosn't run because I know how to use it. I have been doing this for some time--for four years. I steep it for one minute if I kept it in for more than 1-5 minutes I would not be able to go out because it would run. My friend steeps it for 1/2 a minute that way she is able to go out. Give it five days before you give up on it. So good luck to you all.\", 'Butterfinger hot chocolate is very good. It taste like a butterfinger candy bar.

Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />This is why I prefer the smaller bag.  Except for the removal of additional Vitamin K (google on that one), the ingredients haven\\'t changed much since I started in 2008 (when it was EU certified).

I've had many different brands of wasabi peas, and JR is by far my favorite.  Fresh, crunchy, green and very hot (I've tried other brands that were the exact opposite of that).  Only tiny gripe is that I ordered two 5 pound bags, and was going to give one as a gift, but they sent me one humorously large 10 lb bag.  Not a big deal though, I just divided it up.  Anyway, you won't be disappointed!\", \"If you are looking for something that is fast, hot and tasty, this just might be it. A great alternative to coffee.<br /><br />This soup is made in Canada and is all natural with no preservatives . True Knorr or Maggi soup mix might be better if you want to spend 2 to 3 times more. This soup is slightly salty as are most of them, but if you add more water than directed it's not bad at all. For a soup that only takes 1 1/2 min. to make in a microwave and tastes like chicken noodle soup, its excellent. I did not need a spoon to get the noodles and chicken out of my cup, it just slid out with the liquid. And yes there are little pieces of chicken in there, so don't be naive as some of the reviewers and expect big chunks of chicken for this price.<br /><br />For the sale price or even the regular price and with Subscribe & Save plus free Prime shipping it cant be beat for 48 servings. It comes out to 25 to 30 cents a serving. So 5 stars for a soup that tastes really good at a very reasonable price.<br /><br />Note::: I just found this at my local Super WalMart for $1.08 a 4 pack.\", 'I love the Plato line of products as they allow me to just mindlessly pick from the line and know that I am feeding something good to my dog(s).

The dogs don\\'t care what\\'s in these treats, they just know they love them.

There aren\\'t cost cutting fillers in these treats; it\\'s a straight up high quality product. As an aside, I\\'ve bought from the seller, The Whole Healthy Pet many times, and I am always impressed with the products they carry. Just as I know that I can trust the Plato brand, I know that if a product is being carried by The Whole Healthy Pet, then it is a high quality product and I feel like a good parent getting it for my dogs.', \"We have purchased these dried apples several times now.  For me they're a great afternoon snack that satisfies my hunger but also my sweet tooth - they keep me from reaching for chocolate or other less healthy alternatives.

She says that European candies are less sweet and more flavorful. From the ones I've tried, I'd have to agree. Funny, I'd never thought about it before. In any case, we live not to far from a Fresh and Easy market. It's a British company and they have a lot of British things, including candies. I've had several varieties of Cadbury chocolate things that were just extraordinary. As such, this evening I picked up a Cadbury Flake Bar. Mmmmmm, Gooood! That''s just delicious! It's not too sweet and has a nice rich cocoa/chocolate taste. My goodness!

Because the cats will eat them with no problem.  It was always a battle to get any of the other remedies in the cats, half of it ended up on me or the fur or the floor.  The remedy is no good if you can\\'t get it in the cat.  LOL!<br /><br />But every cat I have owned/own loves these \"treats.\"  I do a maintenance feed once a week and when the shedding gets bad I do it every day for three days.

I\\'ve loved ginger snaps since... forever. So, I\\'ve tasted lots of brands both good and bad. Some of them have no ginger taste at all -- We like to call them \"flour snaps!\"<br /><br />Mi-Del Old-Fashion, Swedish Style Ginger Snaps have great taste, healthful ingredients, and I highly recommend dunking in some hot coffee or tea for even more of that comfort food feel!<br /><br />If you don\\'t like them...

They are all excellent.  This is a premium tea, on the high end in quality and in price.  It is good both hot and cold or even at room temperature.  Two bags will make an entire pot of tea.  This tastes different from herbal teas if that has been your usual variation from regular tea.  It is much more distinctive and unusual.  This definitely does suggest the desert when you sip it and also the Middle East.', 'I love these Splenda options and I truly dislike every other sweetener on the market.  Totally Light has mixed in Splenda perfectly (unlike some diet sodas I will not call out by name...).  This read tea peach is very light and refreshing and definitely makes drinking water much more enjoyable!', \"We got a Sodastream for Christmas. My kids have lots of fun making soda, and for them it's really become a passed-fad already and it's only July. For myself though, I think all of the sodas are totally gross except for the Energy drink one. They all have this creepy flavor, I'm not sure what exactly it is?  You know how Coke tastes great, and Walmart  Cola tastes okay, if you had to drink it instead of Coke you would live, right? Well these soda flavors are like three notches below the generic sodas at the store. Like I mentioned, they all have some weird flavor.<br /><br />Except the Energy drink. WOW, if you like Red Bull, then you are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It's like the flavor of Red Bull, bumped up ten times. Plus, I'd say it gives me more energy than Red Bull. Okay, not energy, but the shakes and the so-alert-I-may-explode feeling. It makes me so jittery, IF I drink a lot of it, that I can't think straight and my heart is pounding. If you like that, you'll love this.<br /><br />To me, I look for the Guarna (sp?) in energy drinks, and this has the absoute most guarna flavor of anything I've tried. I LOVE IT.\", 'PB2 is amazing.  My son told me about it as a weight loss product to replace peanut butter.  I ordered it with hesitation, thinking it would be a questionable replacement for my beloved peanut butter.  What a surprise to find it so good and you can make it as creamy as your taste buds desire, by just adding water.  I eat it most days now without adding many calories.', \"My latest beverage addiction.  The only thing I don't like is that temporary noxious cloud that arises when you put it in water.\", \"I like the Newman's Special Blend, and would give it a 4.5 on the 1 to 5 star review range.  It is a little bitter as most stronger coffees are, but not too too bitter.  I would say it leans towards strong on the medium to strong scale, but it's not overwhelming.  If you like a nice normal blend with some kick, and are an advocate of organic initiatives, this is a great pick.<br /><br />I also like to say that I always look to buy the good Newman's Own brands when I can based on the fact that the Newman's Own Foundation continues Paul Newman's commitment to donate all profits to charity.  A fantastic American non-profit company.  You are not forgotten Mr. Paul Newman - RIP.\", \"I had been using this coffee in my K cup machine for several years and found only one coffee, Tully's French Roast, that could equal or beetter it. In my Vue cup machine, the regular vue cup size does not seem as strong as the K cup; so, I ordered the Donut Shop (the Coffee People) travel mug size vue cup and brew it for a ten ounce cup. Doing that makes it better than the K cup version. I happen to like very strong coffee and this vue cup experience may be unique to me. Tully's regular vue cup size is stong enough for me however.  I like the Donut Shop Vue Cup travel mug size sufficient to have set up automatic monthly delivery. I might add that I still order Tully's French Roast for an even stronger non-bitter brew. Variety is one of the great advantages of the Keurig system.\", 'this is my 2\\'nd order with 6.0lp of three boxes with 2lp deferent kinds for my Dearest friend, she loooooooooooves it all kinds but white the most, and i really love the generous of the service they treat there customers, my lady recieved the order less than 24 hours \"Air mail\", fast as much as amazon didnt open the feedback box.  thanks to Leonidas for good quality candy and kindness .', 'My husband is just crazy about these chips!

I even will occasionally lick a swipe off my finger with nothing else it tastes so good.\", \"While I am not a big fan of flavored coffee, this Cinnabon flavor is fantastic!

I would definitely order from this company again.', \"This is the best gluten free pizza crust mix I've tried yet, and I've tried a few others.  My husband eats gluten free because I must, so he is always very vocal on letting me know if a gluten free product is thumbs up or thumbs down--and he really likes this one.  Not at all gritty, no funny tastes (which is his complaint on some of the gluten free breads).  We make one cookie sheet size pizza from one package of this mix.  I've never been a big fan of commercial pizza, but homemade with this mix and my favorite toppings is such a treat!\", 'I have tried many teas and this is my favorite.  I highly recommend it!  Plus you get a cute little statue in each box!', \"This stuff is fabulous.  The flavor is intense yet mellow, a nice true fig flavor and not too sweet.  The seeds are nice and crispy.  This brand is expensive - about 6 or 7 dollars at my local stores that carry it - but this price on Amazon is truly crazy.<br />Here's a good way to use this stuff:  Make a grilled sandwich with turkey breast and a little brie cheese, and on one side inside the sandwich spread a bit of fig spread.  Just need about a Tbsp...and on the other inside, a touch of mayo if you like.  Use big sourdough bread.  Lightly butter the outside of sandwich and grill or cook in panini press, if you have it.<br />OMFG it's GOOOOOOOOOD.\", 'Simply put this is a great alternative to regular potato chips.  These chips are all natural; they have no preservatives or artificial flavors and colors. Each bag brings about 19 chips and are 100 calories (30 calories from fat).  The chips crunchy and have a very light sweet potato taste.  They also have an airy feel to them - like rice cakes. I enjoyed them.  For those that are gluten intolerant, they are also gluten-free.', 'I LOVE these apple chips!  I started eating the bulk Bare Naked Apple chips.  I loved those!  Then I ran out and came back to Amazon to buy more.  They were out of the bulk so I bought these instead.  A little different apple, but with cinnamon - which I love!  I got them and tried them right away.  Totally fell in love with them.  Not only are they organic, but there are only 2 ingredients - organic apples, organic cinnamon!  No preservatives!

THANKS!', 'I drink this tea nearly every day (sometimes twice) and really like the flavor.  With the health benefits of green tea, and the convenience of the Keurig, I drink more of it now than I used to when I did the wait/brew/wait/brew thing with old fashioned tea.  I highly recommend it.', \"I can't tell you how many times I have switched my 8 week old son's formula.  We have tried Enfamil Newborn, AR, and Gentlease, we have tried Baby's Only Soy, Dairy and Similac Alimentum.  Every single one caused my baby some kind of problem, from spitting up to  constipation, gas, and pain while eating.  At 5 weeks he was diagnosed with silent reflux and put on rantidine three times a day.  I did not want to give him prescription drugs at 5 weeks old, but I thought I would try it.  He was in so much pain, it was awful to watch.  It was also affecting his sleep because he could not lie flat without having pain.<br /><br />To make a long story short, the rantidine did nothing to help his reflux.  After two weeks I decided to call it quits.  My pediatrician gave me samples of Alimentum because we suspected a milk protein allergy.  The Allimentum did no good and gave him diarrhea.  I switched back to Gentlease, even though it produced horrible green swamp poops and did not really help anything either.  I almost gave up looking for a good formula, assuming that they were all horrible.<br /><br />We tried everything I could find.  First we bought a probiotic and started that once a day.  It seemed to help aid digestion but did nothing to ease his pain.  Then we switched from Avent to Dr. Brown's bottles, which cut down on the gas and helped a little bit more.  Finally, I decided to give this formula a try.  I was in the middle of a feeding of Gentlease, and he was crying in pain.  Just for kicks I popped open a can of the Baby's Only Lactorelief and BAM!  No pain!  He literally stopped crying right in the middle of the feed, gulped down 4 ounces, and crashed.<br /><br />I did not realize until visiting the NaturesOne website that they do compare this formula to Enfamil Gentlease and Similac Sensitive.  It's the only sensitive organic formula on the market.  The ingredients are similar to that of the other brands but it does not contain corn or hexane-derived DHA/ARA.  It smells and tastes a ton better.<br /><br />I don't think my son is lactose intolerant.  Or maybe he is.  There are also theories out there that some babies are sensitive to corn or DHA.  Whatever the problem, I don't care.  After two days of eating this formula, the only time we are experiencing any discomfort is when he has to burp.  Even that seems very minimal and the burps are easier to coax out.  I always wondered how long I should wait to see results from a new formula.  A day?  A week?  A month?  In this case, I have seen improvement from the very first feed.  I won't say it's perfect yet, but he may have inflammation from the previous formula.  I will update.<br /><br />I know how frustrating it can be to figure out what the problem is if your baby is having reflux issues.  It's trial by fire until you nail something down.  If you are feeding Enfamil Gentlease or Similac Sensitive and would prefer an organic alternative, this is for you.  Please do not let these people who insist that the arsenic will hurt your baby scare you.  Do some research on hexane and DHA and decide which is worse, potential small amounts of arsenic (which is naturally occurring from volcanic activities in the areas of the world where rice is grown) or the hexane derivation process.  This is the ONLY formula on the market which does not contain DHA/ARA.<br /><br />Yes, it's expensive.  But so are Alimentum and Nutramigen, and if your baby needs it, it's worth its weight in gold.  I'm so glad it's working for us, and I could not be happier with it.<br /><br />Update 9-14-12<br />Still working great!  After two weeks, it's almost like my son never had reflux at all!  We still get the occasional feed where he has an episode, but I think that might be stomach related and since he can't tell me, I'll never know.  It seems to help to burp thoroughly when he gets that way.<br /><br />Update 10-3-12<br />Over a month later we are still loving this formula.  I had an extra can of the Dairy formula lying around and wanted to use it up.  It instantly gave my son horrible gas and an upset stomach.  I think he really does have a lactose sensitivity.  I'm so glad Nature's One makes this organic lactose-free formula.  My son is growing and thriving on it, with no reflux issues to speak of.\", 'The lady bugs were very Cute, a great size, they were packaged well, they tasted great and came when it said it would!', 'I used butter instead of the margarine called for, added more chocolate chips (1/2 cup) and the results were amazing. This is a delicious cookie. I\\'m not sure what is happening with people getting a foul taste-prehaps the mix was stale? I freeze these as soon as they cool, then reheat in the microwave for a \"just baked\" flavor. With the butter, and more chocolate chips these taste exactly like the classic tollhouse cookies I used to make.', \"I have tried or will try all the Korma's available.

I used to buy it at Whole Foods but they do not carry it any longer. Whole Foods sold it at a much better price so paying so much more for it plus shippping is not too cool.

I grant you that letting it sit for awhile is the hardest part there are many times that I am so thrilled with this concotion that I consume it on the spot.  sometimes I find myself standing up and eating it all, well most of it.  Of course you can do what you want afterall it's your tuna, but you could put it on salad greens as well or share it with someone.  that's the nice part, they will love it, or you, or both,  thats for sure.\", \"Thanks so much for the peppermint mocha flavor.

My husband made me hide them from him because he quickly polished off about 8 of them and he wanted to make them last!<br />Also, our order was received three days ahead of the estimated time to ship them so that was a big plus.<br />My hubby was thrilled because the company also threw in a free sample pack of honey pepper jerky as a thanks ( the price of which covered the shipping and handling charge, so I feel like I got a good deal).<br />Completely pleased with this product!\", 'I love this delicious tea!  It is a perfect combination of spices, and even if I forget to remove the bag right away (like I just did now) it does not get bitter.

The texture is close to ground beef though not exactly the same, just a bit softer.  I think I like this product the best of the various protein replacements I've tried.

In 25 minutes it is ready to eat. It serves as a hearty main dish for three or as a side dish for a larger family. This is a mildly spicy dish. A few dashes of Tabasco will kick it up for those that like it hot.<br /><br />I was thrilled to see Vigo Black Beans and Rice on Amazon's grocery list. Where I live, this product is hard to find.

I don't have one of those expensive, pod-using, coffeemakers.  I do have a single mug coffeemaker, which I normally fill with water using the provided fourteen ounce mug.  For the purposes of this product, I tried just putting in a cup (8 oz) of water, and placing the pod in the basket.  This produced a weak, undrinkable liquid.  The second time, I filled the pot with 8 oz. again.  I cut open two of the pods and put the coffee in the usual No. 2 filter.  This produced a very strong, but very delicious cup of coffee.  I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.  Filling the one-cup coffeemaker with the usual full mug of water and the contents of two opened pods makes a slightly weaker but still very full-bodied, rich coffee.\", 'If you bake frequently, you can save enough money in a very few months by not buying yeast in little foil envelopes to buy a pretty nice bottle of wine.<br /><br />Active dry yeast will keep almost indefinitely when frozen, so you\\'ll need something to keep it in.

This product does not have the effect of a hypnotic or a benzodiazepine, so one should not expect it to \"knock you out.\" Rather, I do experience a noticeable \"lightening\" of the muscles.

After a few days of no food we faced weeks of gradually adding more and more \"dangerous\" foods back into our diet and observing the results.

There are NO artificial ingredients - and there is NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP and NO CORN SYRUP!  They use REAL SUGAR and that's huge.

The chicken stock was damaged early in the shipping process. I contacted Amazon and they said the $22 something(I don't remember exactly)would be refunded. I purchased these through Amazon as the seller, which eliminated the shipping and handling charge with my Prime membership. I guess that experience with the damaged shipping sort of scared Amazon away from selling it again, because now, the chicken stock is no longer available from them.

They LOVE it.  They have coffee all the time now.  It's very easy to use, clean and makes consistently excellent coffee with plenty of crema.  I expected to see crema on espresso shots, but I'm talking a good head of it on a cup of coffee.  It's so amazing that my dad now makes a coffee for my mom at the first sound of her moving in bed in the morning, which he has never, ever done in the past.  It totally lived up to all the hype and is well worth the money.  Couldn't be happier!\", 'We found this on a shelf in Whole Foods, Palo Alto, CA.  Made in Somerville, MA, we wanted to support my home state and purchased this.  Needing to fill 4 gift bags for our single friends, we wanted something scrummy and nutritious - and this fit the bill.  We have not looked back.  We constantly add it to gift baskets and care packages.  Our personal favorite is the Arrabbiata Sauce. The product is good; the love story behind the company is fun; the containers are fabulous for re-use!  Good people with a good product deserve to be supported and praised.  Buon appetito!', 'We converted to Rice Dream over a year ago.  Our son has autism and had much difficulty (irritability) with digestive issues.  This has been very helpful!', 'We have a dog with tartar problems and these were recommended by our vet.

Highly recommended.', \"I am gluten intolerant, so my choice in chips is limited, not to mention that most of the gluten-free chips don't taste that good.  These chips are truly delicious.  Of course they're not health food, but what chips are?  And they're not organic either, but I've never found a chip that is gluten-free and organic that tastes really good.  I have to say that I love these chips.  I've tried some of the other flavors by the same company, and by far the Sea Salt is my favorite.\", \"I bought this for my partner's 60th birthday. Of course, she had fun seeing all this stuff again - though she said that some of it does not look familiar, probably because it wasn't marketed in NY. Our 11 year old son also enjoyed picking out his dessert from it every day and so did all our elderly friends! I found it funny that all this candy has Nutrition Facts on it, something it didn't when it was first manufactured! We called it the box 'o fun, we loved it so much. A lot of the stuff has peanut butter in it so be careful!\", \"After trying a sample with my new Keurig it was by far my favorite tea.I looked for it at a lot of stores and couldn't find it..... ta da !............

The pieces all arrived in tact and in good condition, and they all fit together properly.<br /><br />As one other person mentioned, it helps if you enjoy the process of pouring the water, waiting, and pouring again. I do enjoy the process, but I also really don't think it takes that long. The water starts draining and dripping almost immediately.<br /><br />I've been looking for an alternative to my french press as part of my ongoing efforts to avoid brewing coffee in a machine that is made of either plastic or aluminum. This absolutely fits the bill.\", 'The purple sticky rice from Barry Farms is very flavorful. The only complaint is the lack of cooking instructions. The first time I cooked it, I used instructions from the Lotus Black Rice package, assuming it would be similar. The rice was still hard, even after 45 minutes of simmering. At that point, we gave up on the timing & just ate it \"crunchy.\" It was very tasty-even with the crunch. I used 1 cup rice, 14oz water with just under a 1/4cup honey & some butter added to the water (during cooking not after.) Everyone in the family loved it, even our son who hates rice. My husband calls it a wonderful breakfast rice, though I think it would make a good dessert rice as well. In our case, we add it to fresh crookneck squash with minced garlic, bacon bits (real not imitation), butter, nature seasoning and 3 tablespoons of water \"steamed\" in the microwave for 4-5 minutes, then add cheese after cooking and \"poured\" over the rice. The sweet and salty mix tastes excellent and seems to please even the most finicky of eaters. (At least in our household!!)<br />For \"real\" cooking instructions for Purple Sticky Rice I found them under a different sub-vendor of Amazon:<br />Rinse well. Place 1 cup rice and 2 cups unsalted water in pan, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer on low for 40 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes. One cup dry yields 2 cups cooked.<br />(Thank you Angelina\\'s Gourmet for putting the instructions on Amazon!!!

He got his name because he was found on the Freeway by Caltrans, he was just a kitten.  Needless to say he is very timid but \"Greenies\" has brought him out of his shell.  He even takes them from my fingers.  I keep the \"Greenies\" in a cupboard under the TV and all the cats come running from everywhere if they hear that cupboard door open.  I feel like the Pied Piper with \"Greenies\".  My best friend loves her cats too so I gave her some \"Greenies\" for them.  My cats. Toes, Ralf.

I fell in love with it where I grew up, in Indiana, and was very upset when I couldn't find it out here. I was thrilled to be able to buy it on Amazon!

They were on clearance ay my local CVS for $1. I wish I had bought them all!<br />The cinnamon and brown sugar flavor is perfect together with the roasted almond flavor. It is not candy coated like other cinnamon almonds (making it a much healthier treat). Everyone that I have shared them with think that they are<br />phenomenal! I highly recommend this product. It is one of the most tasty and healthy snacks you can find. I only wish Amazon would put them on their subscribe and save program.', \"Our extended family goes through a lot of tea and we have some genuine aficionados; some may even say snobs.  We originally tried Newman's Own tea because we liked their other products and appreciate their charitable giving ethos.  What we were expecting, at the price we paid, was a relatively low-grade, re-branded tea.  That is not what we got.<br /><br />What we got was not only a consistently high quality tea, but also an astonishing value.  What really impresses me is that the quality and taste of this tea is so consistent; it's really the best black tea you can find, box after box, for the price anywhere near where they sell it, even much higher.  To be honest, I don't know how they do it but I'm delighted they do.  We buy this tea by the case.<br /><br />The flavor of this tea is crisp and clear, rich, but never bitter.  I had been accustomed to have my tea English-style with cream, but Newman's Own black tea is so flavorful and mellow I've taken to having it straight up all the time.  It's really that good.<br /><br />It would be a tremendous value as it is, but throw in the fact that it is organic, to boot, and it's just a steal.  All the bags in the box are individually wrapped. Personally, I would prefer if they were loose; even though we recycle all the little paper bags they come in, I would feel better if they didn't have those at all.<br /><br />Easy to give this product an enthusiastic five stars.  Highly recommended.\", 'I bake bread regularly and have found this to be the best yeast.  It is used by the professionals and the results are always consistent.

A healthy chip with low sodium and good flavor.  Good for dipping in hummus or eating by themselves.', \"I was looking for a snack that was high in protein but low in fat so I started looking at Beef Jerky, but all the other brands have at least some sort of fat in them, usually a minimum of 1g, which may not sound like much, but when you're dieting, every gram counts. So when I found this brand I was very pleased. It tastes great and did I mention it has zero fat? Oh yeah, I did. But each service (28 oz) only has 50 calories, no carbs and some good protein. Switch to this brand/style. You won't be displeased.\", \"I recently got a miniature Australian Shepherd puppy, and he's been teething a lot due to his baby teeth coming in.<br /><br />I'd read that rawhide is generally not recommended, as it can upset a dog's stomach. I read statements by Cesar Milan and others that bully sticks were preferable to rawhide.<br /><br />These bully sticks are great!  My puppy seems to prefer them to his chew toys as his number one chewing item...  He will chew on one for an hour, and it seems to help his teething and some anxiety. They do have a slight smell, but nothing overpowering, and his strong preference for them makes it well worth it. They also seem to last a very long time (after a week or so, we are still on the first stick, and it looks to last at least another week or two).<br /><br />I did notice today that on rare occasions, the dog can pull at thr side of the strip and get a stringy bit that's probably more than he should swallow...

It has a soothing rich flavor and is great on pancakes. Organic is a must for us. The price seems to be lower than its competitors.', 'I recently purchased a Vienna Superautomatica as an inexpensive second espresso maker. The first thing I noticed is that it is Italian made like many of the great espresso machines. The body of the Vienna is \"graphite\" plastic, and while it does not feel first class, it somehow has a pretty sturdy feel to it. I also like that the footprint is pretty small thus taking up little counter space.<br /><br />I opened the manual, which is not particularly clear, but need not be on account of very simple operation. The Vienna has three buttons--on/off, coffee, and steam. It also has a steamer control knob and a water volume knob.<br /><br />I turned on the machine after filling the coffee and water tanks. The buttons feel Italian--you\\'ll know what I mean if you\\'ve owned an Alfa Romeo. They are a bit clunky next to my old Capresso C1000, but they work well (for now).<br /><br />The Vienna takes a couple of minutes to warm up--I don\\'t mind this for reasons I\\'ll reveal in a minute. The coffee spout is adjustable up and down to accommodate a large variety of cups and mugs. Once it\\'s ready, the coffee light stops blinking. I push the button and it begins to grind the coffee. The noise level of the machine is louder than my Capresso, but not too bad. You might wake up the house with it in the morning, but my child stayed asleep. Once the coffee finishes the grind, the Vienna immediately begins making espresso.<br /><br />My first impression was that I saw a lot more steam coming from the coffee than my Capresso. I am hopeful. The coffee also looked a bit thicker than the Capresso. After the Vienna finished I observed the cup: nice crema, plenty hot, and smells like the genuine article. I gave it a taste--wow, step aside Capresso, this espresso is richer, hotter, and a lot closer to coffee bar espresso. Next I took a sip. Ah yes, the cup holds rich chocolatey espresso. If you are sort of a coffee snob, you\\'ll like what you taste. The coffee is much richer than the Capresso, which I attribute to hotter water and fuller extraction.<br /><br />I\\'m sure that the Vienna will not make good enough espresso for some folks, but to me, it still tastes better than Starbucks. It was more than $100 cheaper than my Capresso and frankly makes better espresso. I cannot yet speak to the durability of the machine, but the Vienna is now my favorite inexpensive espresso maker.', 'I am hooked.  This is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a chore.  This powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners.  It is just what I have been looking for.  Also try the Blueberry version.  Delicious!', 'These bars are awesome! I first tried them at Starbucks, where they cost $2.45 each, plus tax. Amazons price is $1.48 each, almost one dollar in savings! I eat these for breakfast on the go, or for a quick pick me in the afternoon. The Mango/Macadamia Nut are the only ones i have tried so far, but I absolutly plan on trying the other flavors.', \"It is a mixture of chicken, sweet potato and pasta.

I carried it with me when I flew to Texas and when the water holder was damaged, my daughter in Texas bought me a new Senseo pot.

There has to be 2 or 3 whole mangos per can.  If they would use the natural mango juice instead of light sugary syrup they would have a HIT on their hands.  Still, even with the high sugar content, these canned mangos are terrific as a cake or ice cream topping or even just by themselves.

They are easy to swallow and easy on the digestive system.  My daughter absolutely loved the taste and was constantly reaching out for the spoon between bites!<br /><br />I, too, tried the Baby Gourmet food, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious taste.  It had the perfect amount of pear to sweeten the vegetable taste without making a child too accustomed to a sugary taste.

I also purchased the coconut (good but not a wowing taste experience like the apricots) and the cherries (chocolate is too sweet for me on those -- probably the same chocolate as on the apricots but with the tarter cherries, the combination of chocolate and fruit just doesn't work as well for me). I will definitely re-buy the apricots. Ok for those to come in the 4-pack. Wish I didn't have to buy a 4-pack of cherries and coconut.

Do not know quality since this was a gift to someone else.', 'This is a review for the Keysands Live Organic Milk Kefir Grains (Tibetan Milk Mushroom), which is what previously linked here and is being discussed by other reviewers...<br /><br />Like one of the other reviewers, I also purchased two brands of kefir grains at relatively the same time from Amazon. In my case, I ordered these from Bulgaricus and also grains from Lifetime Kefir. I am a fan of both grains, though they produce kefir differing in flavor and consistency.<br /><br />The  Bulgaricus grains arrive in relatively large quantities, allowing one to consume the kefir produced after only one \"healing / restoration\" batch.  The grains are relatively thick in diameter--allowing even courses mesh strainers to be used without worry of too many grains passing through. The kefir produced is rather creamy and fairly viscous.<br /><br />Lifetime Kefir arrives in a very small quantity, and it takes about a week to set up.  The grains themselves are extremely tiny, and even after a month or so of cultivation, the individual grains remain small in diameter. The kefir produced by Lifetime Kefir is stronger in taste (acidity) and somewhat less viscous when compared to Bulgaricus.<br /><br />Another reviewer here was complaining about the curds being thick and (perhaps) overly grainy.  The  Bulgaricus kefir curd does separate substantially from the whey.  I like this, as it allows me to remove the milk serum prior to pushing the curds through the strainer, and thereby to effect a thicker, more yoghurt-like kefir.  Leaving the whey in and re-mixing it with the curds, will yield a thinner kefir drink if that is what you are after.  By contrast, I find it harder to get thicker kefir from the Lifetime Kefir grains when I want it, so I appreciate having both varieties around to process in different ways.<br /><br />In the end I find the Bulgaricus kefir to be a fine strain!', \"I'm a big fan of these - delicious and low cal.

It's much better tasting than plain green tea with a hint of peach. I can drink this a couple of times a day easily.

My somewhat painful contractions started around 9:30pm. I was prepared for the long night ahead at home. Well, by 11:30 I had to wake my husband up to go to the hospital. Once we arrived, medical personnel somewhat took their time to admit me. Guess what, when they checked I was 8.5 dilated and ready to push 20 minutes later. 7 pound baby was born at 3:24am after 6 pushes, without any pain meds. According to my husband he flew out like a rocket. And did I mention it was actually on his due date. I have been drinking this tea before getting pregnant, and then starting second trimester one bag daily, sipping for 20 minutes. During last 2 weeks I used 2 bags a day. It must be the tea, since my mom was in labor with her first for over 20 hours, same as I expected for myself. Seven days later I'm drinking it to help my body heal. Don't get me wrong, labor still hurt like nothing I've felt before, but it was fast and a very profound experience.

Yummy!', 'I like \"Vernor\\'s\", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor\\'s is still aged in oak barrels for 3 , no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor\\'s is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can\\'t find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor\\'s Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is \"The Vernor\\'s Story: From Gnomes to Now\" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company\\'s marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor\\'s fans.', 'This product was recommended by my vet, and literally saved my cat\\'s life.

I have been feeding him \"Friskies\" prior to Hill\\'s and everything was fine until one weekend. After a couple of days of feeding him, I noticed an immediate difference. My cat was no longer passing soft stools (diarrhea), and was eating as he normally did. The diet also seems to have been helping him regulate his weight also.

This is one of my favorites now!<br />Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site too<br />If you like mint tea you'll like this one.\", 'When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my \"baby\" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt\\' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman\\'s Own, it was what lead me to find Newman\\'s Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what\\'s wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker\\'s food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren\\'t supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman\\'s Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans\\' own uses organic.<br /><br />I\\'ll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog\\'s food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that\\'s organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman\\'s Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman\\'s Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it\\'s thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it\\'s organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman\\'s Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it\\'s cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman\\'s own, even if you don\\'t care that it\\'s human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman\\'s Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn\\'s book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He\\'s studied this far more than I\\'ll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn\\'t have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren\\'t outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE \"health\" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept \"treating\" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and \"cured\" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can\\'t cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.', 'I have looked everywhere for these biscuit/cookies.

We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.<br />My brother-in-law has a 14 year old Siamese who was on Science Diet Food for diabetes.

Sylvia's pepper seems to enhance every food, and the taste just gets better and better.  I really think this is black pepper #1!\", \"When I was younger I spent a few months traveling in India. It was before monsoon season and the weather was really hot and exhausting to us.<br /><br />A friend introduced me to coconut water.

It's a delicious coffee, and though stronger than a lot of coffees, I found it very drinkable and am entirely happy with it.  It's strong, but not at all offensive.

I'm not one for a lot of frills - I had been using Old Spice or Suave, but tried the Dove during the winter because my skin was dry. It works.

This is NOT necessary to get great tasting hummus, though. It was just a personal consistency preference. I didn't have any pita bread in the house, but I did have some toasted pita chips and some thin, soft tortilla bread, and both worked perfectly for pairing with the hummus.

They also hate light so they are very hard to just spot. Most of the times I've seen them have been when I was watching TV in the dark and one fluttered by the front of the TV or I've found them hiding in cracks in my closet.<br /><br />I had a serious moth infestation in my clothes. I sorta ignored it until they ate about 10 of my sweaters. They were literally in shreds. When I threw all the wool clothes away they started eating the cotton stuff as well (although not as successfully) so I decided to get these traps because I didn't want to use poisons or whatever. They did a good job of trapping a lot of moths but like the packaging says, these basically will ALERT you that you have a problem they aren't going to totally solve it.<br /><br />Eventually I threw away a lot of old clothes and then washed everything else all at once and put anything wool into plastic bags. The moths WILL attempt to eat your cotton stuff but they don't tend to be as destructive to it (you'll see the cocoons on the clothes but they won't be all full of holes like the wool stuff) Vacumming in your closets will also help get rid of them. I then put cedar chips in my closet. Not quite sure how useful that is but I have definitely slowed them down and haven't seen any more destruction since.<br /><br />I uploaded a photo of one of my traps that caught about 20 moths to prove these do work.

Great taste, moist, good texture - no big holes, etc. I mixed this with a small hand mixer, because I don't have a stand mixer which the recipe actually says to use. I still end up with a very nice bread. It is stickier than a flour based bread that you would knead. Because of that I find it hard to get a really smooth top - no kneading, no rolling, to shape. I even took my Mother a slice. She is a white bread person. She toasted the slice and really liked it. It does taste a bit like a whole grain bread, bit of a sweet tasted. The next load I make, I will probably try a variation and add sharp cheese to the mix.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone wanting a great tasting wheat/gluten free bread mix.\", \"I got my cats on this food after I found one of them urinating blood and refusing to use the litterbox.

I can't sing the praises of this food loud enough.  My cat is no longer straining to urinate, or going outside the box.  I have yet to find a variety either of my kitties don't like.  Just be cautious, if you are looking for a grain free food (which all felines should eat), Weruva does have a couple varieties that contain rice.\", \"This is a great tasting soup, it's addictive.

I was concerned and I opened a can right away and it smelled of strong (garlic or onion?).

One of my dogs has terrible allergies and if I feed her \"normal\" food, she gets terrible dandruff. However, when I bring her out, everyone mentions how soft and shiny her coat is. My vet remarks that her teeth are in amazing shape (no plaque). She has never had bad breath one day in her life nor has she ever been overweight! I attribute this to her diet. She is 49 lbs and she gets two cups per day of Acana, any type, though Grasslands, Pacifica and this have been the best (the others I admit are too expensive for me, and I don\\'t feed chicken). I don\\'t feed wet food, but she does get one or two treats per day as well. My other dog is 30 lbs and she gets 1.5 cups per day as she is a little porker and will find scraps around the house wherever she can. This dog does have bad breath, which we are realize is likely due to digestion. We have switched from Pacifica (which is very high in Omega oils) to this one and her breath has vastly improved. My vet said that terrier breeds usually have poorer digestion, and high fats can cause some bad breath. I am buying Lamb & Okanagan Apple from now on.

I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.

From the long, thin white tea leaves to the jasmine blossom petals, what a treat for the eyes, nose, and palate. The fragrance hits you as soon as you open the container and lasts throughout the cup. I followed the directions and steeped the tea as suggested. The first cup was heavenly, the second brew delicious, but the third was a bit weak. It was never bitter, never harsh, and never \"too green.\"<br /><br />Yes, it\\'s expensive, but it is organic, hand-picked, authentic, whole white tea leaves and whole jasmine petals.

So I added  1 click scoop, 1 cup milk, (some plain vanilla whey protein to increase my protein intake and keep sugars stabilized longer)  then a 1/2 cup of my decaf espresso cold brewed coffee I keep handy in the fridge, a couple of ice cubes, shake some more. OH - it was heavenly.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the mocha - however typically I'm more of a coffee flavor girl, and pure vanilla go together better on my palette.  I love chocolate, love coffee - together not so much my thing. The Mocha Click though works well together, and I have enjoyed it but wished for a more coffee flavor Click.<br /><br />The vanilla click is just that  - it's a richer coffee flavor, stronger but in a good way. For me I find the vanilla click is just smoother - in taste.<br /><br />Now my heart goes clicky Click every single morning.\", \"I bought these at the grocery store. Came to Amazon looking for a bulk buy. ;o)<br /><br />I didn't really know what to expect. These are very light and flaky--I wouldn't say crispy, exactly. They disintegrate as soon as they hit the moisture in your mouth, much like cotton candy does. They have a nice wasabi flavor, strong, but not so hot that it would prevent you from just downing the whole package at once. (Well, not for me anyway. But I am a bit of a wasabi addict.)<br /><br />That said, they are so ephemeral as to be unsatisfying. A better idea might be to wrap these around sushi rice for impromptu maki.\", 'These chips are very good in taste and with more than the usual grams of fiber, a good choice.  They came very fresh and in good shape--no crushed bags.', 'We ordered two large bags. The package arrived on time. The dogs are gobbling it up, they are loving it.', 'I usually don\\'t particularly like shortbread cookies, especially from Scotland, since I think they\\'re too hard, but I buy it for my mom who loves them, so I picked a box up at Marshall\\'s for $5 and instead of their usual, they had \"vanilla shortbread.\"  The picture of the tender looking stylish cookies looked so yummy in the package that I kept it for myself and tried it.  It\\'s made as a \"light viennese style\" shortbread which is why it\\'s soooo soft compared to their usual shortbread cookies.  Also, there\\'s a distinctive vanilla taste to it.  There are 12 shortbreads in the 5.3 oz box.', \"These steel cut oats are wonderful. I usually soak them overnight to cut down on cooking the next morning. Sometimes I'll add blueberries, raspberries or a cut up apple. The texture and the taste can't be beat. Perfect for a cold winter morning. Price is right, too!\", \"My dogs love these treats, because they are so small a bag lasts a long time. It's a great value for the price.\", \"I can't speak for the kids, but as an adult, these rice bars make a perfect snack.  The peanuts provide protein while the rice and chocolate provide carbs.  These bars would be great for anyone with a busy lifestyle.  They're not messy, which makes them an ideal snack while working on the computer.  They're surprisingly tasty and flavorful.  The consistency is very appealing - soft yet crispy.  I buy these a lot.\", \"I needed to find a grind and roast that would fit my need for the taste I was used to with my home espresso machine, a high end Illy that broke and left me after 10 years of service! I went low tech and bought a Bialetti stainless steel 4 cup model with a valve system that creates foam and great crema. The Lavazza crema e gusto ground coffee works perfectly in this pot, only takes a few minutes to brew and the taste is wonderful, full bodied, rich and with no bitterness. For me, it lingers with a bit of smokiness and overtone of dark chocolate. Sometimes I place a very thin 99% cocoa square on the back of my tongue if I'm drinking this coffee later in the day and have a craving for something. It can distract me from many other more caloric choices!\", 'I absolutely love my Keurig. But every now and then I found myself getting bored with the selection of K-Cups. I resorted to buying a reusable K-Cup and filling it with freshly ground beans from Starbucks. The results were less than desirable. I would never get the mesaurements right and I would end up having to make a trip to get coffee.<br />These K-Cups from starbucks are a godsend! the price is not bad. The ratio of coffee grounds to water is the same every time so my coffee comes out great. I am a happy person once again! I also love the house blend because even though it says its a lighter blend, its starbucks. Its roasted darker than most.

I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food. Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.<br /><br />I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis. A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing. I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results. I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food. I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity. I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it. This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:<br /><br />* Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.<br /><br />* Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.<br /><br />* Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />* Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.<br /><br />* Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.<br /><br />* High Digestibility<br /><br />No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.<br /><br />If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco or head to the Natural Balance website. Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals. You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat. I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic. I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days!<br /><br />Note:  This is essentially the same review I wrote about Natural Balance a couple of years ago, but my cat still loves it and I'm still buying it ... on Amazon.\", 'Spam brings back happy memories of a simpler childhood, and happiness was easier to attain.

It is true it is quite salty but what good beef jerky isn't???? My husband a fitness/gym nut LOVES this jerky as well as the high protein content! I also LOVE the extremly low fat content as I cannot stand chewing on leather or fat that never chews away! This product is not only healthy (aside from salt), filling, great tasting, and a great snack thats easy to eat it is also CHEAP! At least in my perspective!

This is an attachment that one must order, it is not the attachment that comes standard with the machine. I had the double pod on hand. I normally use two Senseo pods per small mug of coffee on a daily basis anyway.<br /><br />With the Baronet, I ordered a strong, dark coffee and run both the 2-cup cycle and the one-cup cycle to get a full mug of coffee that suits my taste buds just fine.<br />Very satisfied.', \"I really like this sea salt -- has a different flavor, and it's very colorful to use on veggies.\", 'All I can say is there is nothing more delicious than Carnation Malted Milk.

I love these little, ready-made bottles because they are the perfect size and there is no mixing needed - just shake, open, screw on a nipple, and feed the baby.<br /><br />These don't come with nipples, but you can use regular bottle nipples or get disposable nipples separately.

Everyone here seems to enjoy the flavor of this coffee. Its bold, and strong, and comes out great from the K-Cup.

She stares pointedly between my mother and her food bowl until she gets enough.<br /><br />Since one my cats has some dental problems this cat food is great as a treat that is good for them.\", \"I used this flour regularly these days.. When my son was diagnosed with Celiac and myself with lifelong Gluten Intolerance I learned to mix flours pretty quickly. But mixing flours and keeping them fresh is a difficult task with a 5 1/2 year child under the autism umbrella. Initially, the bean flavor of the flour was not my favorite.. But, I have learned to use it under so many applications it is hardly noticeable... I have written down some of my recipes using Bob's All Purpose Gluten Free Flour mix here.. [...] I use Bob's for my Pumpkin and Morning Muffins as well as Vegan Bread..<br />My son and I are Gluten/Wheat, Dairy, Casein, Soy, Corn and Egg free at this point.

Amazon's price as of this writing is 32.49.<br /><br />Amazon.com shopping tip: if there is only one price shown for the product, as opposed to a 'list price' with a line crossed through it and a cheaper, generic 'price' underneath, then there are likely better options available elsewhere.\", '....even though this was in the fridge for me, my husband grabbed it before I could get to it!  This is typical of him, eating and drinking things I intended to consume; but here is what he had to say about it:  fruity, smooth, no weird after taste like many energy drinks contain.  Did not notice any caffeine buzz or \"energy\" but very good as a beverage.  Would he drink another? Sure, but probably would go for something else with less calories, less sugar, and more of a kick.<br /><br />I have to note that before I placed this in the fridge to chill, I noticed that the entire can contains no more caffeine than a large strong coffee.  The sugar content is high, and for those who want to spare themselves extra calories will not be impressed with that here, but my guess is the that this appeals to a crowd who doesn\\'t (yet) have to worry about caloric intake.', 'Well, according to our 12 week old Miniature Dachshund anyway!

These are as good as candy bars. They DO NOT taste like any sort of \"healthy\" snack bar or anything. Now, some of the other flavors do and I think some of them are gross but this flavor is like eating a dang Chunky candy bar or something. Seriously, they are so good. They are really crumbly though so don\\'t eat them in your jammies watching TV late at night (guilty!) or you will wake up covered in chocolate. :) But if you like nutty chocolate bars you will love these and you won\\'t feel as guilty as if you were eating chocolate candy...but you won\\'t be able to tell that you aren\\'t!', \"We moved our two Bengals from canned Fancy Feast chicken and turkey to Wellness Chicken.  It resolved a diarrhea problem quickly-- we think one of the cats became allergic to something in that Fancy Feast.  They enjoy Wellness much more; they have never attacked any food or treat more voraciously, even real chicken.  Plus, the litter box does not smell as bad, and I feel better about giving them food without nasty byproducts.  This is described as human-quality food, though I haven't been brave enough to try, I believe it.  Instead of smelling like a bag of fast food that got stuck under the seat in my car for a month, this smells like chicken soup.<br /><br />We tried getting our boys onto Avoderm, which definitely made their coats shinier and softer, and even increased their activity level (hard to believe for these Bengals).  However, once the mix got to be over 50% Avoderm, they didn't like the taste.  Can't give a low rating to any cat food because of taste.<br /><br />One note about shipping-- the packaging has not been perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers say.  The second case I received had a few cans with minor dents, but nothing was leaking.  The shipping box is larger than the case, with air-filled plastic pillows to fill the voids.<br /><br />This is not the least expensive food out there, but you are getting a better product.

No more lifting the bag into my car, out of my car, etc.  Amazon and Wellness rock!', \"Great tasting tea and easy to enjoy, it's like a super vitamin tea. You feel good right after your cup. I think I'm addicted to this tea.\", \"My family is really happy that I found this tea on amazon. We all enjoy it. My favorites had been twinings english breakfast and stash's earl grey.

We bought the Spa Select the first time, and I got this one this time.<br />I don't know what the difference is, and I didn't save the bag.  More clarification or a comparison<br />chart from the vendor would be nice.  Even their own site does not really do a good job of this.<br />They compare against other cat food brands, but not within themselves.<br /><br />Anyway, the cats both love it, and the ingredients are very healthy for them.  Little if any fillers.<br />We fill their treat ball with this food, and feed them wet once a day.<br />This is the food they go after at 3 in the morning.\", 'Love the pineapple flavor.

I love lentils for vegetarian meals, though I've made a few spectacular non-vegetarian meals with them as well, including one with diced carrot and celery, turkey bacon, and thyme, sauteed together, then combined with the lentils and a little chicken or veg stock.  I also dump a can into a quick soup, usually with canned tomatoes and some kind of green, like kale.  They are possibly good enough to be eaten straight from the can, but I have yet to be in that much of a hurry.  They're an amazing convenience, and really healthy, so that makes me happy.  I love lentils spicy, savory, in soups and stews, in salads, as side dishes, I've even made a sauce with lentils.  I used to occasionally buy these vacuum-sealed refrigerated lentils from Trader Joe's and they were great, but a little dry and also perishable.

It comes highly recommended. We made ribs using this sauce and were very impressed.

A couple of days before I had run out of regular ground coffee and had a panic attack.  I decided that I would keep a jar of instant around to keep me off a respirator next time.  I decided after returning home to try a cup of this brew.  I have to confess that its not only been a very long time since I have had instant coffee in the house, but its also been a while since I tasted instant anywhere.  Even though I am sure the quality of instant has changed quite a bit since the days of old, I still know a fresh rich aroma when I smell it, and this coffee has as much a delightful bouquet as most  ground coffee I have smelled.  Its richness of flavor is evident by just cracking the jar open.  I used a little more than a level teaspoon for my first cup and found the brew a little weak.  My second cup was with a heaping teaspoon and the improvement was distinct. (On really heavy mornings, try two, it won't kill ya..: ) I found it nothing less than downright delicious.  Although a lot of folks feel compelled to always say that no instant can compare to fresh brewed, I am going to go out on a limb and say that this Nescafe tastes as good to me as most cups of regular blend, moderately priced coffee available.  (Hills Brothers, Maxwell House, Folders, etc).  It can't compete with a gourmet blend for sure, but against the well known familiar competition, it will give it a darn good run. And of course it is a whole lot faster and convenient. This Nescafe is rather easy to find in most grocery stores.  But if you have trouble locating it, by all means get it here on Amazon by the case.  Its very reasonably priced just about anywhere, and just about the best and most delicious you will locate in an instant around this price range.  Highly recommended....\", 'Great crispy gluten free cereal! I like this a lot better than Erewhon rice cereal. Erewhon is overly sweetened, and not as crispy.

I had a favorite recipe and just substituted this Bob\\'s GF flour.  The recipe called for 2 cups of flour, so I used 1 3/4 cups of this product and 1/4 cup of Hazelnut flour(ground hazelnut).  As I was mixing it, I did notice it smelled a little odd--a smell I didn\\'t care for.  From reading some other reviews, I\\'m guessing it\\'s the bean flour.  But I stuck to the recipe, adding sour cream, cinnamon, natural vanilla extract, etc.  Baked it.  When it was cool, I was a little nervous, but when I tasted it, I thought it tasted great.  My mom thought it was delicious and wanted to take some home, even my fast-food loving husband said it was really good and \"doesn\\'t taste gluten free.\"  Not that he\\'s really had any gluten free baked goods.<br /><br />The texture was good.  It didn\\'t rise as much as regular flour, so no spilling in the oven.  Baking time took longer than my original recipe.  Small muffins took about 30 minutes and the glass loaf pan took over an hour.  But on both the texture was good, moist(though a bit more crumbly) and no odd taste or smell in the finished product(despite the smell noticed when I was mixing the batter).  I think I prefer the muffins because they were done sooner and, thus, less brown on top.  Then I just pop them into the toaster oven the next day and they\\'re like fresh baked.<br /><br />I really liked the result for sweets with this product!', \"I add international delight vanilla creamer to this coffee and it is so delicious!

However, I have to say that nowhere on the box, or the individual packets, are instructions for actually making the coffee.  Also it doesn't tell you what type of coffee maker to use or even how much water to use for each packet.  I use K-cups and my daughter uses T-cups.  I had to make this product in my old automatic drip coffee maker, and I had to guess on how much water to use.  Once I was able to make a cup, it was very good.\", \"These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.

It's what our vet recommended when out Boston Terrier was a puppy and he's been eating it ever since. We change up the flavor that we buy occasionally, but he really seems to like the chicken.

When we first learned about BaconSalt, we bought one of each flavor (the basics on Amazon, some special ones on the company website), plus extras for gifts. We sent a half-price gift package to loved ones at an APO address (as of this writing, the company actually gives military buyers/recipients a 50% discount -- imagine that!).

These cookies are quite big so you will need break them up and they are a bit on the hard side but Max loves them.  Just in case you don't know, one of those little cheaper cookie treats is equivalent to a large Snicker's bar to a toy dog breed.  That's far to much sugar.  They are pretty much all natural so I'm able to give her something I would not otherwise.  Newman's makes wholesome good for aniamls products and that should be your main concern when buying.  They are a bit more expensive but worth every bit when it comes to the health on our baby.

This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system.

The chocolate is ok, but I am not a fan of dark chocolate, which this reminds me of. I would be willing to say that the regular is about as close to peter pan peanut butter as I have tasted and that is probably my favorite peanut butter. I will also say this, If someone made you a PB&J sandwich with this, you would be very hard pressed to tell that this was a low fat, low calorie peanut butter. I use the regular and Walden Farms zero calorie, zero carb grabe jelly for a very nice, guilt free PB&J sandwich.

Great taste, and lots of it!', 'For my dog:<br />I have been using this oil for a couple weeks now on & off.  I have just started giving it to my dog (who has been limping & having trouble rising from a sitting & laying position)for about a week now.  HE LOVES IT!  He can\\'t wait to get his dog treat in the morning with it smeared on one side and in the afternoon it is the first thing he eats out of his food (I put about a tablespoon sized dollop on top of his dry dog food).  I have definitely noticed an improvement in his mobility & his coat seems to be much softer.  I had also done some research & found out that it will eliminate stinky dog breath!  I can\\'t wait for that to happen. It is safe for cats too... If you want to know more about giving it to your pets, just do a Google search using the words \"coconut oil for my pets\" and plenty of info will be at your fingertips! :)<br /><br />For my kids:<br />I have done extensive research on Coconut oil & the benefits it has on our bodies. I can tell you that the antiviral benefit it has definitely works. My son (recently turned 12)just recently had a virus that included coughing, a sore throat and had caused him to break out in a rash that only spread onto one side of his body... Doctor said it had to run it\\'s course.  I started giving him some of this oil on toast with the normal butter & cinnamon sugar & within a couple days he started getting better. We stopped giving him the oil & he got sick again... So we started the oil again, but this time HE was putting it on things, himself, to eat--he realized that it was making him better the first time. I think that maybe we didn\\'t give it enough time to work the first time.  For my daughter: After a couple of days of sleeping a ton, being very sick & calling me at work crying because she couldn\\'t stay awake, I took my daughter (13 y.o. then, 17 y.o. now) to the doctor & she was diagnosed with Mono. The doctor explained to me that it is part of the Epstein Barr family (cold sores, herpes, etc.) and that there isn\\'t any kind of medicine that can \"cure\" the illness. He explained that she would sleep a lot, that I needed to call her school & tell them what she had & that she would only be there half days for a few months. I was deflated, stressed & couldn\\'t believe there was nothing I could do for her. I had recently read a book that included coconut oil as a way to detox, lose weight, boost metabolism and so many others and had bought some oil to cook with & take daily. I had done a search & read as much as I could about the coconut & remembered reading that it killed the Epstein Barr virus. I went straight to my computer when I got home & did another search & found the article I had read. I decided to give my daughter the oil twice a day to see if it helped her. I called her down & melted the oil in a spoon & had her take it that afternoon & then again later that evening. The next morning before I left for work I gave her another dose. She called me around lunch time very happy and excited and said she wasn\\'t tired and could stay awake. I remember thinking that the oil was working and was very relieved, but still a bit hesitant. When I got home to my surprise, she was very excited, wide awake & for the first time since she was sick, was chipper and I could tell she was getting back to her old self. I gave her another dose of the oil that evening & for a few days after and she was all better. The oil had killed the virus and restored her health.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing... it cooks food well & is fabulous for your skin.  If you burn in the sun, this will help prevent that as well.  If you are a coconut user this stuff is great...

I received one bar as a sample and went out and bought an entire box that same week! However, even though on the package it says that it tastes great heated up, I didn't like it. Heated up it lost the crunch and seemed to become that dreaded chewy bar.

I will keep it short, because the important thing is that old fashioned Mountain Dew (labeled \"Throwback\" just like \"Heritage\" for Dr. Pepper) tastes much better with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.

She saved a few \"chips\" for me to try when she got home.  I was so impressed with the taste, and the nutrition label, that I immediately thought of my dad.

This rates as one of my top three all time favorites.', 'For many years my cold cereal of choice has been Grape Nuts.  It has a decent flavor, unbeatable crunch, no added sugar, no \"chemistry\" ingredients, and an excellent nutrition profile.  (My hot cereal of choice has been old-fashioned oats w/ Raisins and Brown Sugar.)<br /><br />Well, after a trip to Europe I am now a convert, and this has displaced those faithful Grape Nuts for a permanent place in my pantry.  This remarkable cereal is made of simple ingredients; rolled whole grains (wheat, barley, and oats), dried fruits, seeds, nuts.  (Think granola without the sugar or the baking)  No added sugar, binders, starches, preservatives, oil, flavor enhancers, salt, etc.  For those concerned about processed food intake, take comfort that the only processing this has undergone is that the grains are steamed (which is done during the rolling process; this makes the grains edible), and then the drying of the fruit.  While it doesn\\'t qualify as a \"raw\" food (grains are largely indigestible completely raw) it\\'s much less processed than just about any other cold cereal out there except Granola.<br /><br />While it obviously has no crunch, it has a pleasant chewiness instead after soaking in milk while you take your shower or wait for your coffee to brew.  I usually chop up a banana or toss in some berries if I have them on-hand.  (I tired soaking overnight, and thought it got too mushy)  It has more flavor than the Grape Nuts, and two \"servings\" (2 x a puny 1/4 cup) of this make for a similar nutrition profile.  (The fruit displaces some of the starch for sugar, and the seeds add a trivial amount of fat.)<br /><br />I considered giving some genuine European Muesli a try, but the ones I looked at (Familia) have either sugar and/or a large amount of dried fruit, which, after having this stuff, is totally not necessary.  (Of course, as a Grape Nuts replacement, just about any cereal with sugar in it tastes sweet.)  The amount of dried fruit in this cereal is enough to give it a little flavor, without overwhelming you with cloying sweetness.<br /><br />Don\\'t be fooled by the Kellogs \"Mueslix.\"  They started with traditional Muesli, and then they added unsweetened flakes (corn?) to it.  This introduces soggy nastiness for no particular reason.  I guess they thought suggesting the cereal soak for a few minutes (and leaving out the flakes) would be too complicated.<br /><br />The only \"drawback\" of this cereal is that it feels expensive for the little bag.  However, you can get eight hearty servings out of it, and you\\'d have to resort to some fairly pricey major-brand products to get something this tasty, unprocessed, and healthy.', 'I know there are arguments for and against but I feel dry food is a \"space age\" relic that was good for pet food companies, but not necessarily for pets.  Cats in particular require foods with a high moisture content that dry food lacks.  That doesn\\'t leave canned pet food marketers in the clear either as your definition of acceptable ingredients probably does not include many of the ingredients the FDA and AAFCO considers safe.  (Google the list, it\\'ll be worth it.)<br /><br />My cat normally gets a variety of Wellness and Blue Buffalo Wilderness canned foods.  These are generally considered premium foods but I\\'m always on the lookout for other ways to add variety to her diet.  What I like most about this food is they clearly state the food contains 95% meat.  That is a huge plus that no other pet food I am aware of matches.  I realize other pet foods will list a meat as the first ingredient, but if the second, third, and fourth ingredients are starches, grains, or vegetables you could end up with food that is less than 50% meat even if it\\'s the first ingredient on the list.  Humans are omnivores, dogs are to some extent, but cats must have meat and bones to survive.<br /><br />So many advertised cat food brands contain mostly unhealthy high-carbohydrate ingredients like corn, wheat and so on as primary ingredients that it makes me mad.  You don\\'t see your housecat in the garden pouncing on a wild ear of corn or a potato, do you?  These items should have never made their way into cat foods in the first place.  That is why I am very happy to see a pet food that actually lists a high percentage of meat content on the label.  As you can expect, it tends to be more expensive, almost twice as much as cheap brands.  Consider this, however.  When I opened my eyes to what I was really feeding my pet and switched, my cat ate half as much as the brand-name junk.  It seems once you start feeding your pet real digestible food, they don\\'t need to eat as much of it.<br /><br />Of course the real critic of this food is my cat.  I am happy to report that not only does she like this food but my normally quiet and reserved cat will meow her desire if she catches a whiff of what\\'s inside the can.  Since she rarely meows for anything, that\\'s quite a compliment.  I will be purchasing more of this in the future.', 'We rescued a Cairn Terrier (Toto, Wizard of Oz, was a Cairn.)

My body-builder boyfriend remarked that perhaps if he gets hungry late one night he might pop open a can! It is made from free-range animals, and is processed in a human-grade facility. My only gripe, and it is VERY small, is that most of the food looks the same in the can (particularly the chicken flavors), so it feels like I\\'m not feeding Layla a variety or something special sometimes. And maybe cats prefer it like that--I do know they can be creatures of habit, so who knows?<br /><br />Again, if you have a picky or skinny cat, I would not hesitate to pick up a few cans of either polynesian bbq, steak frites, or grandmother\\'s chicken soup. They are similar in price to other \"luxury\" brands, but the quality of Weruva is far superior.

I am certainly not attributing this solely to the food, but I think the high quality nutrition and supplements she has been receiving have helped Layla heal and perhaps  helped to correct some of her metabolic abnormalities.

It is made in Texas -not China - has pretty wholesome ingredients and from my experience is not unreasonably expensive and the dog loves them. They are crisp and snap easily into smaller pieces if necessary. Now about that product description... it says \"Pack of 5\" and shows 5 Merrick Chicken Steak Patties just like they would look unwrapped from the pack. The problem is that at $60.99 this comes to about $12.00 per patty which IS unreasonably expensive. Ok, so maybe what they mean is that there are 5 of these 5 packs which would be about $2.40 per patty. This is still more than twice as much as they charge for them retail at the local pet food store. In the product description it says the product weighs 1 lb. Well, one 5 pack weighs 2.5 oz. so 5 would only weigh 12.5 oz. The shipping weight is listed as 4.5 lbs!!! I just don\\'t understand how this can possibly be correct.

The 1.6 ounce bar makes a good sized snack for an adult, and is big enough for two young children to share.  The flavor is of sesame and sweetness that is similar to honey.  The bars are solid and do not crumble, but they do bend and can be snapped in two easily.', 'Wonderful flavor and truly versatile. This is a must have in your fridge all the time! Also makes a great gift. I definitely recommend!', 'Smells great and so is the taste.  Fast shipment and packaged well. Will definitely be back and highly recommend.  Aloha from Maui!!!', \"I am addicted to these muffins. It was truly love at first bite. Well actually, they taste better and better with each bite, if you can imagine that. They are soooo good. Think dark chocolate, chewy, dense, with a splash of lemon zest. When a chocolate craving hits, these are my go-to treat. My whole family loves them too. I've never had a better muffin and you would never know they are gluten-free.\", \"I love Kind bars, especially the almond/apricot variety. They're whole foods-mostly just dried fruit and nuts- & taste great. Perfect for grabbing out of my pocket for a quick nibble at work.\", 'These are like a grug to me and its annoying that everyone is going to the Zero which has a horrible after taste.', \"I love these Tamari Almonds, and even my picky eater husband likes them. It has hint of rich Tamari soy sauce flavor that is not too salty or overwhelming. It's hard to stop eating them once you start! It's an added bonus that it's organic too.\", 'My dogs really love these treats.  We have tried all favors of these Healthy Bones and they are a hit.', \"Teisseire is a French company that still makes the best syrups out there, with no nasty ingredients in them. High quality products for at least 20 years!<br /><br />Mint syrup is my favorite, and I used to drink a ton of it when I lived in Belgium and France. Add it to ice water or, even better, to sparkling water for delicious, refreshing soft drink. Highly recommended! And if you'd like to try another flavor, get the grenadine flavor (that one can be added to vanilla ice cream for a delicious treat).\", 'Stash sells cheap tea, but, I really prefer it.  The Bergamot (orange extract) they\\'re using is fantastic with their black tea, which is also quite decent.

So i decided to try this..all natural ingriedients...so very good. Will be buying more...finally I found a great sauce to put over spaghetti and ravioli!! Very very happy with this purchase. Loved the sturdy containers...re-usable!! Try it..you wont go back to the grocery store, I promise!!', 'I got this for Christmas and will be ordering it for myself when this bag is gone.

I have made 4 recipes with this product and it has definitely enhanced the flavor. Very fair price for the 1/2 lb purchase of lavender spice.', 'Our sweet dog (Brenda Lee) loves this food and it is great for her too.  Smells and looks good enough to serve to house guests on crackers.  However we would never do that as it would make (Brenda Lee) mad.

Some Kettle Chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch!  They arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from Amazon Grocery have been.  Great flavor and All Natural!', 'I know that coffee reviews are subjective -- we all have different tastes and preferences, right? So I\\'m writing my review based on my own preferences for a light roast coffee with a \"soft\" flavor (rather than overly bitter or bold). This is currently my 100% absolutely favorite k-cup flavor. While it\\'s brewing I get the distinct aroma of cinnamon rolls. I brew in a Keurig B40 and choose the 9.25oz serving size and think the brew strength is exactly right. My usual method of serving is to heat about 6 ounces of skim milk in the microwave for 1 minute, add about 1 tablespoon SF Torani Vanilla Syrup and froth using my Aerolatte thingie. Then I add the coffee to the milk and stir gentle. It\\'s as good as anything I can get at Starbucks!', 'With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can\\'t recommend these chips enough.  You won\\'t regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren\\'t.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and you\\'ll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I\\'m also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.', 'When I received this \"Lickety Stik\", I really wasn\\'t sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it.  If I even go near the bottle he starts wagging his tail and giving me the excited look.  One aspect about this doohickey I really like is that you can use it as a reward for your pet, without constantly having to give him a biscuit or similar treat; just a lick off the Lickety Stik will do the trick!  The occasional biscuit and treat is okay, but this is much better for active training.  Highly recommend, though you may want to shy away from trying it yourself.', 'This is not an extraordinarily hot hot sauce, despite the product description emphasizing the habanero peppers within and it being \"Extra Hot\". It IS a extraordinarily tasty sauce, and aromatic to boot.<br />Yum! Accept no substitutes.<br /><br />Well, do it if you have to, but then go get some Melinda\\'s.', \"My husband can't drink coffee or decaf so he drinks this every morning.  It is very convenient for me to buy it via Amazon as I can buy a large quantity in one shot.

Saves me time from running from place to place looking for it.\", \"This is a great product.  I can use it in the shower and not have to switch to any other product.

This order keeps me going for weeks.', 'Before I tried a \\'Juicy Pear Jelly Belly\\' jelly bean, I\\'d never tasted anything like it, except real fruit. The flavor that explodes in your mouth right away is of a juicy pear; I kid you not. Buying a pound of them finally gave me a chance to keep them around for awhile, because I\\'ve always had a hard time not eating them all. I love the licorice beans too, and I really love all the fruit flavors: green apple, peach, cherry, lime, grapefruit, lime, grapefruit, lemon and tangerine, but nothing wows my taste buds like the \"juicy pear\". I would order more if the shipping cost weren\\'t so high.', \"I get this product every 6 months, without fail.  Seems my Wal-Mart doesn't carry it anymore.  Don't ever get hooked on anything and expect Wal-Mart to keep carrying it.  Anyway, drink this wonderful tasting and keeps me full through the afternoon between meals.

I buy it in bulk and leave it my car.\", 'I ordered these mangoes and it came earlier than expected. After I opened the package I started eating it right away and it was amazing. It is not too sugary because it does not have any added sugars, just the natural fruit sugar and was just the right amount of sweet.

I will definitely buy some more.', \"First of all, these are 1 cup pods.  It does not make a full pot.<br /><br />That being said, I made a pot at work to share with my co-workers.

I have a great deal of very long, very fine, very straight hair, and generally I find that conditioners leave my hair feeling not conditioned enough (and sadly dry and static-y, particularly since I moved to the desert) or far too weighed down by product. This conditioner did neither -- it just left my hair feeling thick and shiny and smooth. I haven't been using it long enough to see if it really reduces split ends -- I brush carefully, so I'm not particularly prone to them anyway -- but it's worth the price even if that particular claim is bunk, because my hair has never in my life felt this healthy before.\", 'You get a lot of flavor for 100 calories with these Pop Chips. I hesitated ordering them until I heard Jullian Michaels (trainer from the Biggest Loser) mention it as a substitute for potato chips. So glad that I ordered them.', 'Good price. Pretty simple to apply. I took a long screwdriver and hammered that down into the soil then rotated. Took out a spike capped it and hammered in down about 2\" below the surface. Now waiting to see better growth this spring and summer.', 'Years ago I had a wonderful Italian meal in Boston. I was told at the time that the distinct flavor was due to the Locatelli cheese. I carried a piece of paper with the name for many years but could never find in Calif. or on the internet. Imagine my surprise when I ran into and purchased said cheese from Amazon. The supplier who sent it, did a great job of packing and was prompt in delivery. It is a very nice cheese.', \"This is one of my favorite coffees. I used to buy it ground in bags locally but they stopped carrying it. It's smooth, light and not bitter at all. Beautiful caramel/nutty undertones give it a very nice after taste.

Now, she eats the whole helping in less than 30 seconds.  She really seems to like this food.  I will be sticking to this brand it looks like.\", 'This is definitely my all time favorite flavored Keurig k-cup.  Pretty much tastes like a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks.', 'Our daughter is 9 months old and loves this food. She can sometimes eat a whole container at one sitting!<br /><br />In addition to it being organic and having interesting flavor combinations (without getting too bold with the spices, which can turn our daughter off), I like that the food contains salba seed. According to my research, salba is fibrous and absorbs water, so it helps with digestion. If your child tends toward constipation, as ours sometimes does, this can really help move things along without being harsh. I also like the combinations of fruit and veg used in these pouches, which keeps the food from being overly sweet yet makes some of the trickier vegs more appealing.<br /><br />We have tried four different kinds of the Happy Tot pouches and all of them, even the one with peas in it, have passed the test. She actually gets excited when she sees one of us coming with a pouch in our hands!<br /><br />I make it a point to taste everything that I am feeding to our daughter. I think these foods taste good and have no reservations about giving them to her.', 'I use so much of this and it is so convienient to get this by the case.', \"I decided to get this item for my new shelter dog.

He has had it for well over a month now and has not even made his way through 25% of it yet.  It doesn't have a smell and it hasn't broke off into pieces.

It is so yummy!<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, I know, that's not the idea behind the cinnamon challenge.  But, I assure you - this is much easier to swallow in 30 seconds, and better for you too.  (Yes, cinnamon is good for you, but it is very questionable, indeed, whether or not its healthy for you to swallow a teaspoon of dry, ground cinnamon.)<br /><br />This is really delicious.  The cinnamon is a spicy-sweet kind of cinnamon, reminiscent of Saigon cinnamon.  Very zesty - it enlivens the palate with its warm, exotic spice.

You can use either the seasoned rice vinegar which is sweet or the original, and go easy on the sesame oil, it is very strong and can overpower your dish. We also add a bit of canola oil, just a suggestion. I originally had these noodles at the Luau, a wonderful restaurant that we went to when I was a child and I have loved them ever since. Wonderful texture and take on the flavors you imbue them with. They can also be fried in very hot canola or peanut oil for a crunch in salads...very versatile and great to have on hand.

I went through quite a few brands, and many dollars, and most were just TOOOO bitingly bitter for my tastebuds - until I happened upon the Perugina at, of all places, my local produce market, owned by some very nice Korean folks.<br /><br />This is the best dark variety of chocolate I've eaten at ANY price.  I break off two squares (it's conveniently scored) which amounts to approx. .3 ounce, and let each one melt in my mouth.  The texture is silky smooth and the bittersweet is not TOO bitter!<br /><br />There may be more discerning tastebuds out there but for my taste this is perfect.\", 'This is great jerky.  The meat is tender and not overly-dried.

It is tart, and I like to add sweetener or sugar to mine. I don't care for honey with this one. In the summer you can use it to make the Passion lemonade, mix it with a lemon-lime soda for a fruit punch-like flavor & fizz, or just pour it over ice by itself. In cold weather, serve it hot for a flavor that's just as exquisite. There are a couple of drawbacks-- one is that it's hard to find in stores, and when you do, you won't get as good a price as you do on Amazon. The other is that when people see the rich reddish/pink color and smell the fruity aroma, they'll be slipping your teabags into their pockets for themselves. I've been brewing it by the pitcher to drink cold this summer and have cut way back on soda as a result. If you don't drink it that often, the bags are individually sealed, so you won't have to worry about them going bad.

I was surprised at how cheap they were thru this seller.  I placed my order on 7/5/11 and received the package on 7/11 so not a bad turnaround.  As reviewed by others the beans were soft, fragrent (but not artificially perfumed) and supple.  I think these beans were even a lil longer in length and thicker than what I'd seen in stores.

I thought it was so tender and delicious, and I wanted to buy some for myself. I found it on Amazon.com believe it or not!!!  Anyway, I ordered 6 pounds of it. All 6 pounds are now gone. This popcorn is REALLY good. It is different than other popcorns I have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate. I consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because I have eaten it every night since I was a little girl. I usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time, but since the kernels are so small, I ate it by the handful. My only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped. I wish I could find it locally so I would not have to pay for the shipping costs. If you like popcorn, I highly recommend it.\", \"This product is definitely a hit with my two finicky cats.  One is 9 years old, the other is 2 years old.  I was trying to find a natural, yet affordable wet cat food for my boys because I noticed that their feces was carrying a potent odor.  I read many sites which suggested natural food, which is better for their digestive system and ultimately fecal odor (as I use natural cat litter without perfumes or deorderizers).  This product has definitely helped me to achieve my goal.  While the litter box is not odor free, the odor has significantly reduced.  The food is super moist and has a good portion of watery natural juice (not gravy), which they like to sop up before eating the food itself.  This is good, as my older boy doesn't like to drink much water.<br /><br />I also notice that my boys do not get as hungry after eating this food.  With my old, highly commercialized brand, they would each eat 3 portions per day.  With this new food, they stay full for most of the day, only needing 2 portions per day, which is even more savings in my book!  Definitely a plus!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.  It's a great deal when purchased with Subscribe and Save.  I say, at least give it a try.  If you don't want to commit to a full case, see if any pet stores like PetSmart of Petco have single cans so that you can try it out with your cat(s).  You may also want to try a few flavors to see which are their favs.  If it's a hit, make sure to Subscribe and Save on Amazon!

The cocoa flavor is deep and lingers in the mouth, the mark of a good chocolate, beyond what you would expect from the middling 38% cocoa content (most premium milk chocolate starts at 40%, 50% is common and there are some bars with 60% cocoa). The fact their cacao is sourced from Latin America helps, as South America is the ancestral home of cacao, and American cacao (specially from Venezuela, Ecuador and Trinidad) tends to be better than the industrial forastero grades grown in Africa or Indonesia. This chocolate was also conched properly, with a very smooth texture. The hazelnuts it is blended with are hard to discern, however. They may contribute to the smoothness.<br /><br />This is world-class chocolate. I would not hesitate to put it in the same company as the best from Valrhona, Cluizel, Guittard or Hachez. The price is relatively moderate for premium chocolate.<br /><br />I tend to be suspicious of the Fairtrade label. Their certification is expensive, and most of the money goes to pay Western experts than the poor farmers it purports to help.

To further explain, I use this to wake up in the morning and it allows me to productive in a calm manner without the frantic panic that can sometimes come from having too much caffeine.  This tea is a great value per ounce compared to bagged tea.  A little goes a long way.  In fact, a little pinch appears to expand to 7X it's volume after puttting in the water -- besides the flower bud tea I have had, I have not seen this amount of expansion in other teas before and definatly not the expansion I have seen from any bagged tea.

However, they've got quite a bit of fat and more than a few calories in them.<br /><br />Honey Maid cinnamon graham crackers have a comparable amount of calories to Stacy's pita chips, make no mistake, but the fat content is lower.  Also, the price is far better for Honey Maid graham crackers than it is for Stacy's pita chips.<br /><br />In any case, these cinnamon graham crackers are a great substitute for Stacy's pita chips.  The cinnamon crackers are a favorite of mine to grab as a snack with a tall glass of cold skim milk.  They have a satisfying crunch to them when I bite into them, though I could do without the crumbs all over.  They're also great to take on the road for those times I get hungry (those crumbs are easily brushed off of my clothes, after all).<br /><br />I highly recommend these.

I like getting cereal with ingredients that i can read, a low amount of fat and sugar. I do not have the world's biggest sweet tooth so just a little sweetness for me goes a long way.<br /><br />This cereal is perfect. I feel the same way for the original and cinnamon verisons. They are large crunchy puffs that stand up well in soy or almond milk. They have a great peanut butter flavor while not being over the top sweet. I am glad to see this on amazon for much cheaper than what organic stores sell it for. I got it while it was on sale 4 boxes for 9.92, you seriously can not beat that for just about any cereal now a days.

I read statements by Cesar Milan and others that bully sticks were preferable to rawhide.<br /><br />These bully sticks are great!  My puppy seems to prefer them to his chew toys as his number one chewing item...  He will chew on one for an hour, and it seems to help his teething and some anxiety. They do have a slight smell, but nothing overpowering, and his strong preference for them makes it well worth it. They also seem to last a very long time (after a week or so, we are still on the first stick, and it looks to last at least another week or two).<br /><br />I did notice today that on rare occasions, the dog can pull at thr side of the strip and get a stringy bit that's probably more than he should swallow...  This very rarely happens (ive only seen it once in a week), but it goes without saying, if possible keep an eye on the dog while he's chewing on these, just in case.\", 'a must for all cats especially outdoor to eliminate  urinary problems...works well for pet health...no infections since commencment of purina diet...', 'Devine dark chocolate.

It's unfortunate that even in some formulas there are HFCS. It's unbelievable. So these pouches are great being organic and healthy.<br /><br />The true benefit though is the packaging. These are so convenient to use on the go.<br /><br />We made a trip to Disneyland, and these pouches were a life saver. In the past, we've used just a little container and a spoon to feed the baby, but it really ends up being a mess. On the trip, the baby could just snack on the food straight from the pouch with hardly any mess (we would hold the pouch so it wouldn't get messy).<br /><br />You take the green cap off and then it's perfect for the baby to just suck on it and get the baby food out.<br /><br />Highly recommended for using when you're on a trip or in a restaurant and the baby wants some food, but you don't want to create a mess.\", 'I ordered the King Cake mix so that I could bake my own cake for Mardi Gras.

That worrid me, but Vet said they\\'re not bad, and introducted me to C.E.T. bones.  Dogs have been on them for long time now, and I continue, oftened, to buy C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral... chews.<br /><br />And when so much time passed, and recently Vet both dogs teeth, the older dog, her teeth are the same, they arn\\'t worse.  That to me is GREAT.  Now I order from whoever has the better prices for C.E.T. chews.

Just letting all the Dog lovers know this.)<br /><br />We\\'ve been using these Chews for so long, and when it\\'s time to give each of them one, all I say is \"how about a \\'Chewy Bone\\'....WOW, no matter where they are in the house, they come a running, right to the closet in kitchen where I store them.  They also, when I open the pantry, they run to other room, next to kitchen, and sit and wait, while their tails wag alot.  That, at least to me, tells me they really like them.<br /><br />So for anyone out there who wants to know what I think.....I think these C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral ARE THE BEST, and I would NOT recommend any other chewy bones, especially rawhide, or any other hard bone.<br /><br />If this previous isn\\'t enough to convince you, I don\\'t know what else to say, other than \"Maybe you should at least try 1 bag, even if you pay postage.  I bet after that 1 bag, depending on size, which I buy the 30 extra large, which is much better price, they have small, medium, the right sizes for any dogs.<br /><br />That\\'s about it.

Especially when I have a cough and/or cold I brew some and pour it in a bowl to inhale the chamomile vapors. It works just great. Of course I also love to drink it when I'm sick.

He\\'s primarily a ZP venison kind of guy due to allergies, but with trying to introduce new protein sources to him I\\'ve turned to the other varieties of ZP including the Venison and Fish and Lamb. Both were gobbled down without hesitation. Clearly he doesn\\'t know that the food is good for him, or I suspect that he would be requiring it to be doused with canned food! But that is the wonderful thing about ZP - it is super high quality with no grains or fillers AND dogs love it. And my boy Titan looks better than he ever has; he\\'s always been a strong dog, but on ZP he looks like he lifts weights. He\\'s been on an exclusive ZP diet for about 4 or 5 months and his coat is shiny and velvety like a champion racehorse.<br /><br />Something to attest to the supreme flavor of this food: recently I was running low on ZP and so I had to supplement with some raw venison. I put down a bowl of raw venison for him while I was rationing out the ZP. He pushed the raw venison chunks around and then looked at me and gave me that familiar nod as if to say \"you gonna give me some of that?\" No raw venison for him. Titan wanted his ZP and nothing more.', 'I was very happy to find several sources for bulk gelatin at amazon.  I enabled be to compare prices and pick the cheapest product.

I wasn't sure what I'd gotten myself into when I first tried a spoonful.  The texture reminded me a bit of crisco (uh!), but it immediately started to warm on my tongue and there was a heavenly, light coconut aftertaste that reminded me a bit of an almond joy bar (without the almond or chocolate).  I prefer not to eat it by the spoonful because of the consistency, but really like spreading it on a graham cracker, the taste of which reminds me of coconut cream pie with a graham cracker crust. I also like cooking with it, and didn't notice coconut-tasting chicken. I recently ordered a larger amount of coconut oil and tried a different brand, but I prefer the Nature's Way flavor. I'll use the other brand as a moisturizing cream, and order more of the Nature's Way for eating and cooking. It's wonderful for moisturizing after a shower, or for using right before bed when the coconut scent is restful. This is my favorite brand, and I'm sticking to it.\", \"I love regular wheat bran flakes.  They're becoming difficult to find in grocery stores.

The Italian blend has the perfect combo of strength & fullness, without the bite.  It is sooo smooth.

They are durable enough that pieces don\\'t break off and there is minimal risk of choking.  They seem to last forever but are soft enough that the dogs want to chew on them.  I bought the largest size because I have medium and large sized dogs.  That also minimizes risk of choke and/or other injury.  They are also easy to spot in the yard when mowing the grass.  If you do accidentally run one over, they break or splinter and leave sharp edges.  I would remove them from your dogs yard in that event.  Otherwise, the dogs seem to like them (are willing to pick them up, take them from you, and carry them around) and chew on them quite often.

I can't attest to the five hours (didn't quite pay attention), but it did last for quite a while and I had no crash effect in the end. I wasn't overly anxious or nervous, but I could think clearly and get the work done that I needed to get done. So it most definately delivers on its promises.<br /><br />The things that I like the most is the fact that there is no sugar. I also appreciate the fact that they use water instead of carbonated water, which is the main reason I don't like the Monsters, Rockstar, Red Bull, etc products (diet versions, of course). It also gives all this energy in 2 ounces instead of having to drink a large soda can worth of drink. The taste wasn't fantastic, but it could have been much worst and only takes a good gulp to get it all down.<br /><br />I've been looking for a product like this to get me going in the mornings and this seems to fit the bill. My only problem with this is that it is a bit on the pricey side. Today I am also trying out one that is similar, called Enduroshot, a 2.2 ounce energy shot that claims all the same benefits that this promises but at a MUCH lower price. I'll do a review on that sometime soon in the future. If I feel just as awake and alert as I do with 5-hour energy, then I will use it instead.

Although the raisins were tasty, the box had about 20% dark raisins.  We wrote the Sun Maid Company and expressed our disappointment.  Evidently this occurrence was something they did not expect or accept.  They told us that there is no way to avoid having a few dark raisins in the box but that this box was not representative of their fine product.

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.\", \"Love the White Mocha and have tried the sauce vs. power.

We weren't expecting much, and we certainly weren't expecting her to suck it down happily and hungrily!  We've stopped fighting with her to take the bottle - what a relief that mealtimes aren't a battle anymore and she's not fussy all day from hunger.  We thought the Alimentum and Nutramigen were the same, but obviously they aren't because our picky little eater won't touch the Alimentum but loves the Nutramigen.

She had a lot of staining on her front teeth and canines and a lot of hard calculus on her large premolars.  (See image I posted above for reference.) The vet had to remove one of her large bottom premolars due to the amount of decay.  After the surgery, I committed to brushing her teeth two to three times per week, but that wasn\\'t enough.  The tartar and calculus came back within months.  I began to get concerned that I\\'d have to get her teeth cleaned again and they\\'d have to (eventually) remove her other large, bottom premolar.  (Imagine a dog without its bottom premolars!) Despite my rigorous brushing, the calculus would not come off.  Going against the advice of many vets, I BBQ\\'d a slab of beef ribs and let her chew on them, but she refused to gnaw on them.  She\\'d remove the meat and leave the bone. I then went to the pet store and spent about $20 on an assortment of chewable bones in hopes one of them would do the trick. The first one I gave her was the Purina Busy Bone.  She went right at it and consumed almost the whole thing within 20 minutes.  I let her consume the rest of it the following day, but didn\\'t expect to see a difference so fast, so I didn\\'t inspect her teeth immediately.  A couple days later while brushing her teeth, I couldn\\'t believe how much of the calculus was gone.  I was so relieved that I wouldn\\'t have to get her teeth professionally cleaned again and that I\\'d found something safe and effective to keep her tartar and calculus at bay.  I committed to buying several of these while they were on sale.<br /><br />The only downside to these Busy Bones is that they get really sticky when wet.  Your dog\\'s paws and legs WILL be sticky after chewing on one of these, so be prepared.  Either let them do it outside or plan on wiping their legs afterwards.  (It\\'s a small price to pay, though.)<br /><br />I really feel for the guy with the corgi whose dog almost choked when the Busy Bone became lodged (see review titled, \"Dangerous Choking Hazard\").  As a result, I will certainly monitor my dog while she\\'s chewing on these in the future.<br /><br />Good luck everyone.', \"These pretzels are one of our favorite gluten free snacks.

It's not necessarily the ZICO flavor i grab after a workout, as i still love pineapple (though chocolate is great in my morning recovery smoothie), but it has definitely replaced my mid-afternoon snacking habit in a much healthier way.  Best of all - i've got the whole house hooked on it, so my kids now choose healthy hydration instead of the artificial and high calorie stuff they used to drink.  i'm sold.\", \"I don't like sweet potatoes but I do like sweet potato fries.  I love these Popchips Sweet Potato Chips, they are very tasty.  There isn't a lot of salt, fat, or carbs.  My only complaint is each bag only contains .8 ounces, but I guess they wanted the bag to be exactly 100 calories.<br /><br />The rest of the Popchips line is great too.  Not fried or baked, and reasonably healthy.\", 'Nut free and not just sugar. I tried a pack and they were surprisingly good! They are not hard to chew..kind of melt. I love that they are nut free. My 2 yr old liked them too. Will order again!', \"I think these are some of the best sardines I've ever had (barring the old style two-layer in sild sardine oil - does anyone pack them that way any more?).  There didn't seem to be any negatives with these.  They are small, tasty, and a great snack when you've just gotta have a good sardine and don't want those 3-to-a-can ones (you know, the ones that used to be 18 cents a can).  Would buy these again any day of the week.\", 'If I were a real adult, I could just drink plain water and be happy. And, yes, most of the time I CAN just drink plain water and be happy, but sometimes a little boost of vitamins, energy and yes, delicious fruit flavor can satisfy the 10-year old in me, especially after a big workout, when I seem to crave a Gatorade something fierce. This stuff does it. Just a squirt turns your water into a tasty combination of Gatorade and vitamin water. And one bottle lasts a long time, too. Thumbs up.', \"Gosh I have been looking for this stuff forever.

Love them.', \"Ok, I know some of you may not like the choice of my words, 'mental orgasm'- but, once you try this cheese, you will agree.<br />I first tried some at a local cider mill last month and knew it was love at first bite. Once I got home, I called local stores in the area that carried a nice selection of cheeses. I can't keep enough on hand, it's that good...Just get yourself some crackers and you're set! I also grated some over pasta with olive oil, and grated some over tomato's then put it under the broiler. It has a nice dry consistency and the merlot is not overpowering. I highly recommend this award winning cheese!\", 'I\\'ve been using this about a week now.  Works better than any other yeast I\\'ve used.  Surprisingly enough, even the flavor is better:  less intrusive, gentler, not quite as \"acid\" as some of the other fast yeasts I\\'ve bought.<br /><br />BUT THE KICKER WAS TODAY\\'S RYE BREAD.  I used what I thought was a live sourdough starter for a 3-lb. loaf of rye bread.  No go.

I\\'m sitting here looking at the loaf that\\'s JUST come out of the oven.  Beautifully risen, beautifully scented.

Right away the scent hits you and just makes you think this tea will be very spicey and sharp.<br />Once it\\'s made, it seems to have a warm \"fresh baked\" flavor to it but still a very strong (pleasant) ginger-spice flavor.

This one can get a bit too strong very quick.<br /><br />I was afraid to try it for the longest time, since I\\'m not a HUGE fan of gingerbread, but wow.

Very little needed for pan frying and adds a subtle but tasty flavor to vegetables.', \"I absolutely love Click! I have tried several protein drinks, wasted tons of money and were are all gross! I can tolerate two and Click is one of them. It's smooth and the coffee flavor covers up the protein flavor for the most part. I add a little sugar free syrup or a dash of pumpkin spice and a little pumpkin and I have a satisfying drink that wont take 500 calories out of my day. I do use a Magic Bullet to mix mine though, but with that I have never had an issue with mixing it. I have also never tried it warm, so I can't comment on that either. I have been a loyal customer for over a year now and will likely remain so.\", \"I use these bars (macadamia and apricot are my favorite) as meal replacements on the go.

I definitely recommend subscribing. It's a great service.\", 'We switched to this dog food after our 12 yr old mixed breed dog started losing weight and developed severe dermatitis, itching, scratching and shedding!

One that she consistently loves is any kind of Addiction's raw dehydrated food. She can barely contain herself while it rehydrates a bit. So much so, that I've started using hot water to speed the process along; otherwise, it's just such drama while she waits for it. This dehydrated option takes up so little room compared to dealing with clunky cans, and as long as she's happy, I'm happy. I try a different flavor everytime I order just to keep her interested. So far, so good!\", \"This drink is just wonderful.  Although it has caffeine, it doesn't have an alarming amount.  The great thing about this drink is all of the vitamins (I'm not good about taking a multivitamin...).  I drink this fairly diluted; with at least 32 ounces of water instead of 16 ounces and the flavor is just right.  The citrus is my favorite and, sadly, they don't carry that at Costco anymore.

I like the bottle, it is not as easily recognized by guests as the bold blue & white H&S that everybody instantly recognizes as anti-dandruff shampoo - nobody wants to advertise that they have dandruff.<br />4.

It has a hint of the original Market Spice flavor in it (the tell tale cloves and orange)  but not enough to take the flavor as a whole out of the \"Breakfast\" realm nor make it so you can\\'t add milk if you like.  It\\'s not just for breakfast of course and it\\'s very popular with my heavy tea drinking family.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for folks who like both Market Spice and traditional Breakfast teas or for folks who like Market Spice but don\\'t particularly want to get punched in the face by it all the time!  lol', 'I ordered two boxes of the Hershery bars for a party I was having.

Not as much flavor. Back to almond-walnut-macadamia bars.<br /><br />I've gone through a few boxes of the KIND bars named for their alleged content of almonds, walnuts, and macadamias. I haven't encountered any of the funny tastes, apparent staleness, or wrappers horribly stuck to the bars, that some reviewers have mentioned. As other reviewers point out, there are a lot of peanuts relative to the content of walnuts, macadamias, and walnuts. But it tastes good nonetheless, and for the price ($1.06 per bar if you buy on subscription) it  strikes me as a good value. This is a relatively high-calorie snack bar (almost 200 cal), but it's also high protein (10g), has extremely little saturated fat, and a relatively low amount of sugar. It's substantial enough that you can easily resist eating a second bar. The bars also contain some worthy vitamins and minerals in amounts sufficient to matter. So far, knock wood, the deliveries on Amazon's subscription have been fast and the product has arrived in excellent condition. I don't expect to get a gourmet no-peanuts bar for this price--it's a good product and good value at this price.\", \"I picked these up on sale at Costco.  Great price, great product.

When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over.

This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a \"clean\" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.

I decided to try them out, because they were cheaper than the Lansinoh bags I have been using.<br /><br />I love, love, LOVE these bags!  And the fact that they\\'re biodegradable makes me like them even more.  While I do agree with a previous reviewer saying that there wasn\\'t a spot to put the volume size, I just use the place where it says \"name\" since I know my baby is getting it anyway.<br /><br />You won\\'t be disappointed with these bags!  The company itself is amazing too, they will give you free samples of the bags if you ask for them on their Facebook page, and also they do giveaways every Friday-last Friday I won a free 25 pack of storage bags :)', 'I bought this milk for making mozzarella, ricotta, and paneer cheese (which it does very well) and have ended up using it for everything.  I mix up a quart at a time in a blender for daily drinking and add a tablespoon or two of heavy cream.  A hint for mixing:  put 1/2 the water in the blender, add the milk powder and pulse blend a few times before adding the remaining water.  Once blended, it can be very foamy.  Stir cream in with a spoon and allow to sit in the fridge for a day before decanting into a glass bottle.', 'This gum has a terrific taste. It does not have that overwhelming cinnamon taste that burns your mouth. It has a pleasant, sweet, cinnamon flavor.  The Xylitol is considered a safe alternative sweetener and is also actually good for your teeth. Great to freshen your breath, quench your thirst or divert you from that bowl of potato chips! It really does help me stay on track with my healthy eating!  I highly recommend it.', \"Manischewitz is our favorite potato pancake mix and the new family-size canisters are terrific. It's an easy product to use with quick preparation and not as salty as many other prepared mixes. The results are just delicious.

Highly recommend!\", 'My Wife loves this tea, she takes many times daily, its flavor is soft, its organic and with excellent price.', 'This product is perfect for someone who eats no sugar. Xylitol is a wonderful alternative to sugar. Unlike sugar there are actually health benefits from consuming Xylitol.', \"My favorite candy by far.  Just the right amount of chocolate and peanut.

Yep I'm a huge fan :)\", \"My review title says it all but I'm happy to add that my husband is happier knowing that he'll never run out of his favorite tea.  No more looking around for his tea at sale price.  I especially love that it's delivered to my doorstep.  Saves me so much time - and gasoline!  Thanks for the wonderful service and products you provide.\", 'Classic French mints made from mineral water of the spa town Vichy.  I think there was a queen of either France or England who once declared these as her favorite sweets.  They come not individually wrapped, but all in one bag.  They are white, chalky and standard size for hard candy.  They are so addicting and so good.  Has a more subtle mint taste.  More sweet like candy than an American mint. More like a dessert than a breath-freshener.  I love them.', 'This bread is really delicious. It has a very dense chewy texture and makes very good toast. I spread some hummus on it. A very healthy treat that tastes great!', 'Wonderful coffee. I have tried many different k-cups, and like Goldilocks, I found some to be to strong, some to be too weak, but this one is just right. No bitterness, no acidity, just pure coffee taste. I enjoy flavored coffees but sometimes just want a plain old coffee, and this is THE ONE for me. After having experimented with many others, I will stick with this one.', 'These cookies are fantastic!!  They don\\'t taste gluten free at all.  My boys and I love these cookies.  They also are not high in sugar and have some fiber in them.  They are also casein free, soy free, nut free, among other things \"free\".  And, they are made in a dedicated gluten free facility.  We used to eat the kinickinnick animal cookie.  Now, we\\'ve moved on to these.  Again, the best GF/CF/soy free cookie we\\'ve ever had.  You won\\'t be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S.

Every now and then I need to actually get things done, and with two goldens its quite a challenge.  I like to give them their everlasting treat ball filled with the vanilla mint treat.  It keeps them quite and busy for about an hour.  The treats can be a little difficult to get into the ball and first, but the more you use it the easier it is.  It seems like the big box pet stores and also my local supermarket do not carry these in size large.  They only seems to stock small and mediums.  Very convenient ordering through Amazon.  If you need a little time, these work great to keep the pups occupied and they have nice breath too!<br /><br />Cheryl', \"I absolutely love this product.  The cats enjoy them and they keep hairballs away.  I have signed up for auto-ship because I couldn't live without them.\", 'I like most varieties of Primal Strips. They are a fantastic snack for active vegetarians (10g protein, 2g fat, 8g carbs.). The Thai Peanut variety is very tasty with a little bit of a kick. The texture is firm, which I enjoy, but it typically gets stuck between my teeth so I always need to have some dental floss handy.', \"This is the heartiest of the Eden Miso packets and it does have a very good flavor along with great lasting quality (it took me over a year to use up 3 packs). People tend to make the mistake of thinking that because Miso is soy based it will be salty when mixed with liquid but this is less often the case. You can add soy sauce or Tamari for salt purpose, Miso is just the base. I saw a review that panned this Eden Shiro Miso, Organic Rice & Soybean, 12.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3) but Miso and Rice are about the most bland combination you can start with and must be seasoned to taste. That's why I start with this Barley mix, it has a more robust flavor to begin with but making Miso is about finding the base flavor that you like beyond the seasoning which comes later (some might prefer a thinner rice base). So in sum this Miso Barley has a strong flavor, holds up well to just about any use including thicker sauces and can provide a lot of base when mixed into soup.\", 'I had high hopes when I ordered this supplement, purportedly for one of my sons who was having some transitional stress issues...but I needed it as much (if not more.)  We have not been disappointed.  In fact, this supplement has exceeded all  hopes and expectations.  I suspect that my anxiety issues were beginning to negatively impact an important relationship. That has improved as have all my other relationships.  I am much more patient and centered, much less needy.  I have also noticed that there are no more occasional heart palpitations, no more twitchy legs either...no twitches of any kind. Also, as a budding middle-aged runner, this product IS helpful with muscle recovery.  I wish we had known about this product when our younger son was running track and cross country in high school.  It would have been tremendously helpful.  As others have noted, \"Calm\" is a wonderful aid in getting a restful night\\'s sleep. A good night\\'s sleep in-and-of itself is tremendously important to one\\'s overall health. I will try never let myself run out of this supplement.  What a discovery!', 'My Shetland Sheepdog, Baird, has some dirty teeth. He\\'s also... weird... for a dog. He doesn\\'t chew on ANYTHING really. I mean, as a puppy he chewed the wall once, but we sprayed that with some of that nasty tasting spray stuff and since then, no problem.<br /><br />He used to love to chew on cow hooves, but for some reason he just seems to enjoy licking them now (maybe he likes the pasture flavorings). He doesn\\'t chew any of his chew toys.<br /><br />So how do you clean a dog\\'s teeth if they don\\'t chew on anything? The answer is brushing (which is always good regardless of whether your dog chews or not!) and not much else.<br /><br />While at the vet I saw the CET Enzymatic HEXTRA Premium chews. $30 a bag for 30 chews. It seemed excessive, but to keep from having to put Baird through the scary procedure of a full teeth cleaning, it seems a small price to pay. My fear was he wouldn\\'t chew on them. Turns out... he LOVES them!<br /><br />The thing is, the $30 price tag really got me, so I decided to try to find something a little cheaper, when I happened upon Amazon and found the \"one step down from top of the line\" Virbac (makers of the CET chews), \"C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Large Dogs, 30 Chews.\" It\\'s not completely clear what the exact differences between these and the HEXTRA Premiums, but the chews do smell different (I think this has to do with the chicken flavoring on these which the Premiums don\\'t have).<br /><br />And it turns out Baird loves these as well.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that if your dog has yellowed teeth, simple chews won\\'t fix that. All you can do is get those teeth deep cleaned... however, this is just generally surface staining, so brushing and providing chews like these will actually clear the plaque. And the plaque is the part you are worried about, given that\\'s what can cause health problems with your dogs.<br /><br />Over all, I\\'m happy that Baird\\'s happy with these chews. If you can\\'t brush your dog\\'s teeth all the time, these make an OK alternative to brushing. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P05K7W\">C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews with Chlorhexidine, Large Dogs, 30 Chews</a> are available as well, they are just a few dollars more. Next time I order I will most likely go with the Premiums out of nothing more than personal preference.', 'This is basically a Velveeta version of Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Mac, which if you add extra seasonings, is pretty good along with being a cheap meal. I have to say Hamburger Helper has just met its match.<br /><br />You cook up the hamburger the same way, add in water, a seasoning package, and then the noodles. Then, when the water is absorbed, you add in a package of Velveeta cheese. YUMMY!! It really made the meal pop with a great cheesy flavor without being too cheesy, a problem that I commonly have when cooking with Velveeta.<br /><br />I also like the fact that the macaroni noodles were a larger noodle. Typically you get little elbow macaroni noodles in the Hamburger Helper. That just added to the filling meal.<br /><br />I recommend this. It comes out to be about $2.50 a box when ordered off Amazon, which is cheaper than buying Hamburger Helping in the store. It is a good, hearty meal good for any family.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVDs.', 'A friend of mine recently brought some of this back with her from Seattle.

It almost tastes like liquid candy, but without the sugar. As soon as I heard it was available on Amazon, I ordered 2 pounds.<br /><br />I was speaking to another friend, who\\'s from Seattle, and told her I found this amazing tea. Before I could finish, she said \"Marketspice?\" She grew up on the stuff, and hadn\\'t had any in years until I brought some over.

I've become a quick fan, and like it so much that I'm gonna sign up for the subscribe & save to receive a box every two months.

We are both partial to the dark cherry flavor. Texture is also really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. You don't have to sit there chewing forever, but if you want u can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect! The only fruit snack that I have had that is in my opinion slightly better than these, is Annie's brand. However, Annie's is at least double (closer to triple) the price of these.

Buying through Amazon is cheaper than buying online from Godiva directly. I can't find the Dark Chocolate Caramel Gems in grocery stores near my house.

I was very pleased with these noodles, I have had other Shirataki noodles before (can\\'t remember the brand exactly) but these were much better. Don\\'t be alarmed at the horrid smell when you open the pouch (I certainly was lol), that as I understand it, is the odor given off by the presearving agent, and has no affect on the taste of the noodle. Simply rinse them thoroughly in a collander until the smell is gone/extremely faint. Once boiled as instructed the smell will not be present in the noodle, and as I said the noodles do not taste like that smell. Miracle Noodles are completely flavorless and the texture of this brand is much more palatable than the other brand I tried. I think the Miracle noodles are akin to \"Ramen\" noodles as far as texture goes (this only applies to the angel hair variety, I have not tried other shapes). I had these with my homemade tomato sauce and they took on the flavor of the sauce entirely. I love them, I will deffinately be ordering them again.

Many reviewers find the sodium content high and, as with most soups, it is. A good workaround to resolve this is to pour in about half of the flavor packet. There is minimal flavor change and a decrease (even though it may be slight) in sodium.

Soon I realized it was just more flavorful and actually less sweet - I had been conditioned to equate sweetness with flavour.  It has a hint of cinnamon - a Mexican Vanilla type taste that I can't get enough of.  The carbonation level is just right, in my opinion.  I love a nice bite and this cola seems to have about as much as Coke does.  I can imagine Colas tasted like this in the early 1900s - its everything a Cola should be.<br />Boylan doesn't compromise on anything.  They only sell their products in glass bottles to preserve an authentic taste.

I sometimes blend in a little more wild rice  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5OMA\">Lundberg Organic Wild Rice, 8-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>  You can also make your own custom blends with various Lundberg rices.<br />Ca $20 for 6 bags, w free shipping on orders >$25 (the price at the time of this writing) is a good deal.<br /><br />The only problem is that it can be hard to cook it just right.  Oddly, most published rice cooking instructions produce wet undercooked rice for me.  The following is my formula which works just right for any brown rice.  It produces firm dry, but fully cooked, rice, which is particularly ideal for mixing with cooked meat and/or vegetables (e.g., stir fry) or adding to soups immediately before serving.  To cook white rice, just alter the time to 15--20 minutes.<br /><br />COOKING INSTRUCTIONS<br />1) add 1 1/2 cups of water to an uncovered 2 1/2 quart sausepan<br />2) on HIGH bring the water to a boil, in the meantime measure 1 cup of rice.<br />3) as soon as the water begins to boil, turn the stove OFF (or take the pot off the burner), add the rice, and stir*<br />4) set the stove burner to LOW, set a timer for 30-40 minutes, and cover<br />5) when the timer goes off, immediately remove from the stove, uncover, stir and \"fluff up\" the rice with a plastic spatula, and leave uncovered for 1/2 hour.<br />6) after a half-hour, cover the rice until time to eat it.<br /><br />*If you simply dump rice into a pot of boiling water, and slap a lid on it, it will boil over and make a mess---you need to let the burner (particularly if ceramic) and pot (particular if heavy) cool down a little before you put the lid on.  The quickest and easiest way is to simply turn the burner off for the few seconds it takes to stir in the rice.<br /><br />DO NOT SUBSTITUTE BROTH FOR THE WATER; DO NOT ADD BUTTER OR OIL---you\\'ll almost certainly get wet, undercooked, rice.  If you want to add flavor, add olive oil or butter, and Braggs Aminos or bullion AFTER the rice is fully cooked.<br /><br />CAUTION<br />On my glass-top (Kitchen Aide) range, I\\'ve found that I cannot cook ANYTHING simultaneously with the rice.  If the oven or ANY other burner is in use (or if the stove is merely warm from recent use), the temperature sensing circuitry of the range turns off the burner with the rice, with the result that the rice is undercooked.<br /><br />SALVAGING UNDERCOOKED RICE<br />You can\\'t just put the rice back on the burner---you\\'ll get glop.  Assuming that you started with 1 cup of dry rice:  Pack the rice into a 24oz covered casserole, for example <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MZPII\">Marinex 23.7-Ounce Small Round Casserole with Lid</a> and microwave for 5 minutes.  The result will be PERFECT rice.  Really!!!  IT REALLY WORKS!!!<br /><br />COOKING IN A MICROWAVE<br />Add 1 cup dry rice and 1/2 cup water to a 24oz covered casserole, microwave 5 minutes(at \"low\" or half-power).  Add another 1/2 water, microwave 5 minutes(at \"low\" or half-power).  Add the third 1/2 cup water and microwave 5 minutes(at \"low\" or half-power).<br /><br />General Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.<br /><br />To see my, \"How to Cook Rice\" for more details<br />click on \"See all my reviews\" above, then click on \"So you\\'d like to know\" guides on the left side of the page', \"I put two tea bags in a gallon Mason jar, and add a half cup or so of Davidson's cranberry orange bulk tea.

The machine was purchased at Sam's Club where the popcorn packs were not available. Not finding this in town, we went to Amazon where we found exactly what we needed.

When we first opened the case we thought that the butter/oil was old and had solidified. We needed to look it up on the Great American Popcorn site to assure ourselves that we did not need to send it back.

Except my acne scars is a huge problem for me for the moment.<br />My sisters and I also use it for deep hair conditioning, and some facial treatments.<br />Coconut Oil is creamy and delicious as well. I love eating this with my toast and putting it in my favorite coconut chicken curry. I've noticed when eating coconut oil or just adding it into my food my appetite isn't as big as it was before. Not sure if its because its a healthy type of fat.But anyway I absolutely love, love , love this product.<br /><br />however with the acne part, its not for everyone.

Now, thanks to the internet, I don't have to travel to far off Minnesota or buy tiny expensive packets in the local health food cooperative. There's plenty of wild rice available for anyone who wants it these days, but as the demand has grown, the industry has changes. A lot of wild rice isn't really wild anymore. It's farmed in rice paddies. And a lot of wild rice is dried in industrial drums fueled by propane, much the same way coffee is roasted. You'll see a lot of dark black, hard rice sold as wild rice. Maybe that's all you've ever seen.<br /><br />Bineshii still does it the old fashioned way. The rice is wild, harvested by canoe, slow dried over a wood fire. The result is a flavorful, tender, ultra-long grain that has a light nut-brown color and a delicacy no other rice can match. It's so tender, you don't even need to cook it. You can soak it overnight in water and it will soak up enough water to become edible raw -- sort of like pasta al dente. It really comes into its glory when you cook it though, with wonderful curled sweet nutty grains that are so delicious I hate to serve it as a side dish. I usually just eat the rice and nothing else. That's how good it is!<br /><br />Bineshii is a group of Native Americans and they do more than just rice. They make preserves, soap, totems, kinnick kinnick, birch bark art pieces, and even have an instant mix Ojibwe fry bread, if you have a hankering.

Bob\\'s Red Mill Low-Carb Baking Mix enables us to make pancakes, waffles, muffins, etc., etc. that are \"Zone friendly\" so we can stay \"in the zone\" and still eat many of the things we were missing while on the Zone program (which, if you haven\\'t tried and want to improve your nutrition or lose weight, you really should!).  Thank you Bob\\'s Red Mill for another great product!', \"I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.<br /><br />I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.<br /><br />I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.<br /><br />Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog.\", 'I bought these for myself because of being on weight watchers and sometimes I want that salty snack.  My husband and friends who are not watching their weight also loved them.', \"My dog loves these so much, he actually waits by the drawer in the kitchen every morning until I give him one.  I ran out one day, and tried to give him another treat, but he would not take it.  So I had to run out and get more.  He just expects one every morning now.  I was telling a friend about them one evening and he heard me say 'checkup chew' and he went to the drawer so now  he even knows them by name.\", 'This Ras El Hanout is a wonderful, authentic  spice that is difficult to recreate yourself.  It\\'s hard to find and really enhances Middle Eastern cuisine.  This blend  includes lavender and roses, as well as more common cinnamon and cumin. Ras El Hanout gives a distinctive Middle Eastern flavor to a dish.  I use it in my Moroccan chicken, which I prepare in a crock pot.  A tagine would of course be even better!  For my recipe, I use organic  boneless chicken, a few tablespoons of high quality extra virgin olive oil,  potatoes or sweet potatoes,  quartered onions, lots of \"baby\" carrots, chick peas, cans of whole or diced tomatoes, diced garlic, honey, diced/chopped dried fruit such as apricots and/or prunes, chopped preserved lemon (you can buy or very easy to make), and then some  additional cinnamon and cumin, plus black pepper in addition to Ras Al Hanout to taste.  You do want to add enough to really flavor the \"stew.\"  Moroccan chicken is very healthy and  fantastic served over whole wheat couscous.  For a lower carb version, you can omit the potatoes and serve over greens.  My kids love it, but it\\'s also special enough for company.  If you enjoy Moroccan food or experimenting with spices, it\\'s a great addition to your pantry!', 'Energy drinks are considerably higher price than coke/pepsi etc.  Your bang for your buck is here on a product that tastes very very much like Red Bull.

I usually put it in milk.<br /><br />Another thing, this is not just for bodybuilding.  I had a nagging shoulder injury for months, after I started taking extra protien, it healed rapidly.  It really does make a difference for soft tissue injuries.<br /><br />I also find that it kills my appetite.

This is now more than 20 years ago.  They are packed in various sauces and oils but my favorite is pure olive oil and lightly smoked, wild caught from the cold waters off Scotland.  I cannot imagine doing better than that.  Most sardine lovers whether they eat them for health (they contain over 2,500mg of Omega 3 fatty acids) or just as a wonderful gourmet food love the tiny ones.  The taste is nut-like and delicious.

More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It\\'s all the same healthful Natural CALM.<br /><br />Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer\\'s comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn\\'t do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary.

Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water.\"<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It\\'s confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there\\'s the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors?

The problem is that when my husband and I go overnight hiking I need my daily cup. I\\'ve had bad experiences with instant coffee in the past but I decided to give it another try. I went to a local grocery store and picked out this brand, based on the fact that it had the highest price tag and was organic. It may be false logic but I figured if it was the costliest item in the \"instant\" category it couldn\\'t be awful.  Well, it was way beyond my expectations!  I brew it very strong when hiking (water is precious) by adding a normal amount to an espresso-sized cup.  And it\\'s not half bad!  I even make it at home once in a while by putting it in milk and adding ice to make it nice and cold. Not as good as my Toddy coffee but it works well in a pinch. My only complaint is that it is a bit one-dimensional.  A bit flat and smooth compared a fresh cup of joe.  However it is not unpleasant, and preferable to any other instant I have tried.  It comes sooooo close to the real thing, and I recommend it to anyone in need of instant coffee.', 'I recently found out about these products and I love this breakfast sausages.

Some typical weaker mint tea variants need delicate handling and are better only iced with only a little sugar or honey and no milk.

Dr. J now recognizes their label! He wanted to taste test the Double Chocolate first, and of course this chocoholic mommy did not protest!<br /><br />Remember, Enjoy Life Foods products are free of the top 8 food allergens. Could that kind of product make a double chocolate cookie that tastes \"real\"?<br /><br />Um, YES! My mouth waited for the rice aftertaste, but it couldn\\'t find one. Enjoy Life Foods created a chocolate taste on par with homemade, and the crunch satisfied! The boys loved them, as you can see, but I was elated! I confess I hid the rest of the box and saved them for me, though guilt did kick in later and I shared one more with them, ha!<br /><br />Now, it would have been very easy to gorge ourselves and eat all four boxes at once, but I needed to test these cookies on a non gluten- and dairy-free eater...Daddy! The next night we had another taste test, this time trying two cookies: Chocolate Chip and Vanilla Honey Graham. Again the boys loved them! And Daddy? My pickiest taste tester of all things allergy-friendly? What was his verdict?<br /><br />Good! He preferred the chocolate chip, but said the Vanilla Honey Graham was decent. There\\'s an ever-so-slight after taste to the graham cookies, but Meatball didn\\'t seem to mind!<br /><br />If you\\'ve been counting, there is one more flavor left--Sugar Crisp. Now, I grew up with a Type 1 diabetic mom. The sugar cookies she made were reduced sugar, and I loved them. Most other sugar cookies were always too sweet for me. I figured this would be the case as well, and Daddy and Meatball would get the bulk of the sugar cookies.<br /><br />Wrong! When I bit into my first Sugar Crisp, I was amazed. There was a buttery flavor to it. I grabbed the box--was there some mistake? Was dairy hidden there and somehow Enjoy Life Foods missed it, marketed it wrong? What were the ingredients? How did they get that flavor?<br /><br />I don\\'t know! But there\\'s still no dairy in there! The Sugar Crisp had just the right sweetness, and of course the same satisfying crunch. I ate a lot of them. At first Dr. J didn\\'t want them because they looked a whole lot like another sugar cookie he had tried and not liked. I asked him to please try a bite, and of course he didn\\'t like them. However, after two days of watching Mommy and Meatball eat them, he finally gave them another taste, and was quite happy to consume some himself!<br /><br />I think we can happily say Enjoy Life Foods Crunchy Cookies will definitely be a back up plan for when Mommy forgot to make cookies and we need to take a treat somewhere. My flavor preferences in order were: Double Chocolate, Chocolate Chip and Sugar Crisp tied (seriously, who would have thought!), and finally the Vanilla Honey Graham. Some of you will be able to find them in your local allergy-friendly grocery stores now, and some of you will need to be watching (and ASKING) for them as Enjoy Life Foods continues to get them into the market. You all have my permission to eat two Double Chocolate cookies when you get them--one for you, and one for me!<br /><br />Enjoy Life Foods sent us their Crunchy Cookies for taste testing and honest review. All opinions, and cookie crumbs in the keyboard, are my own. You can learn more about these cookies and their other new products here at their website. I also want to thank them for donating crunchy cookies to our Southeast Michigan Spectrum Moms family picnic in May.', 'Over the last two years, our older cat (now 11 years old) had ongoing issues with diarrhea and vomiting.  After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach.  We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering.<br /><br />She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic.  At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her.<br /><br />Last month I decided I didn\\'t have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms.  I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had.  Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to \"getting older\" or her \"hairball sensitivity\" since none of the test had pinpointed a problem.<br /><br />After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food.  I didn\\'t bother to transition her, just started her on it right away.  Besides, she wasn\\'t keeping down much of the other food anyway.  She took to it right away, and she\\'s a picky one.<br />Within two days, the diarrhea was gone.  Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat.  It\\'s been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I\\'d found this food sooner.  No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box.  My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true.  A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor.  I didn\\'t believe it until I...well...didn\\'t smell it.<br /><br />I\\'m transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it.  The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food.  You\\'ll also want to note that it doesn\\'t have preservatives, so it\\'s bound to have a stronger smell.  The wet food actually smells good, for cat food.  We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken.  I\\'m sure our experiences will vary, but I\\'ve watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit.  So I\\'d say she gives her claw of approval.<br /><br />Bottom line?  It\\'s pricy, sure.  But it\\'s worth it for us.  Considering the money we\\'re saving in paper towel clean up expenses alone, we\\'re probably saving a buck or two.  I should also thank Amazon for making it Prime eligible, so it\\'s easier to buy it here than to find it in the store.  So now, instead of begging me to feed them, our cats can start mauling the UPS man.', \"These have a lot of flavor in them, will satisfy that craving for something crunchy, and are a great alternative to other snack foods that are full of fat and MSG.

The red tea taste is more dominant, the white tea taste subtle. I have to say that I like the red and white blend more than the red alone. I still probably prefer white tea more, but this blend is lovely, and lower in caffeine (the red tea has no caffeine, the white tea a bit). This tea contains only South African rooibos (another word for red tea) and white tea.<br /><br />The package says that it contains a hint of sweetness, and I\\'d agree, although the taste is very hard to describe (if you\\'ve had red tea before then you understand). The package also says that this tea is full of \"potent antioxidants\", which of course is very healthy.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash\\'s Fusion Red & White Tea unless you do not care for rooibos or white tea; otherwise you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />*****', \"What can I say!

I pulled the pork apart in the juices from the bag and it was as good as any pulled pork I've had.\", 'A can of tasty small fish in tomato sauce, which offsets the fishy taste and smell quite a bit.  What was really a surprise to me is how good they tasted when I warmed them up in the microwave for just about ten seconds to take the chill off.<br /><br />Try these tasty little tomato sauce sardines to add some variety to your sardine diet.', \"This is definitely one of my favorites it has a fresh and great coffee taste, it's delicious. This will definitely be a must buy for those that like strong (almost espresso) coffee. If you need some energy and a nice strong kick in the morning this is definitely the coffee for you. I know I do, I live in NYC and have an awful commute in the morning. So, I need lots of caffeine to get through my commute and the rest of the day. I wasn't really getting that from some of my other coffee choices of the k-cups. I just got my machine and I am experimenting with all the extra and extra-extra bold coffees and so far between this one and the Timothy's Parisian Nights. So, so good I love them!! This is very addicting, strong coffee!!! ;o)\", \"I was sure that there was never a chip that I loved enough to give it 5 stars. But while traveling I bought a bag of these chips ($3.97 I might add) at a natural market type store and just loved them (other than the price).<br /><br />The chips themselves don't have a high oil or greasy taste that some enjoy, but the selection of spices and herbs that Garden of Eatin' has developed is just GREAT.<br /><br />I have bought three cases so far and just love them!\", 'This is a great alternative to peanut butter. Great taste without the fat or calories.  This should be in every heath conscious pantry. a great travel food as well.  Can be easily reconstituted on an airplane, or in the office during a busy day.', 'I have five cats so getting all of them to like a food can be difficult. I give them wetfood as a weekly treat and this is the only type they all love and devour! They all love the gravy and two in particular mostly just lick the gravy so this is more food for my buck!', 'Great quality at a good price and pure yumminess!!! I ate them! It felt like eating a jar of healthy goodness.<br />Thanks!', 'I make iced tea with this.  It is very tasty, like their bottled teas, but at a fraction of the cost.', 'I am committed to getting unfermented soy products out of my diet.  I find that most chocolate candies use soy lecithin as an emulsifier.  After finding out that soy lecithin is pretty much the sludge that is left over after chemicals like hexane are used to extract the oil from soybeans, I decided that I want nothing to do with it.  (In the days before corn and soy crops were subsidized by the government, we got lecithin from eggs, not soy sludge.)  Enjoy Life chips are soy free and they taste great.  I use them to make my own mint truffles.']\n"

      "['I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend. I had more than 4 cups of coffee before I noticed on the packaging that it said House Blend instead of Kona Blend. I would not have known that it was not the Kona Blend had I not seen the packaging. One caveat: I make \"lattes\" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.  Someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor.My bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the Kona Blend, due to vendor and shipping costs, and it is more than good enough for me.  I've since ordered another box.', 'I don't typically like banana flavored stuff. I'm not that crazy about adding bananas in my shakes. But this banana cookie bar is FREAKIN AWESOME. It is so delicious. I share them with friends all the time and the only friend that didn't like it just had a thing about not liking dates (and the ONLY three ingredients in this bar-o-goodness are: almonds, dates, and unsweetened bananas). THANK YOU LARA FOR YOUR DELICIOUSNESS IN A BAR. Just as tasty as it is nutritious ... and THAT is somewhat difficulat to find in \"ready to eat\" foods.', 'This food is the best.  Our golden retriever who is prone to all sorts of allergies is scratch free with this food.  Thanks Amazon for making it so easy to order online.', 'Purchase this olive oil for all the great flavors it came with, enjoy cooking with them and using them in salads. Would recommend this brand.', \"These are better than any I have ever purchased in Whole Foods, Fresh Market, or any place!  The price is outstanding and can't be beat.  I can't wait to make some cranberry bread out of these!One of my favorite ways to eat them is to mix them with walnuts and a few chocolate chips.  (dark chocolate of course)It satisfies my sweet tooth and a healthy snack, to boot.I'm really looking forward to trying the cherries when these are gone!  I would have bought cherries first but didn't see them until I had already ordered these.  I'm not disappointed!I hope the price stays the same!\", \"Although this is of the more viscous kind, it smells good and has a nice sweet taste. I have been using it as a sugar substitute and it has worked very well. It's a bit pricey compared to all the other commercial, processed honey available, but well worth it. Buy the 2 pack, you won't regret it.\", \"I have 7 cats, ranging in age from 15 years, down to 2 years & they ALL LOVE THIS!  I used to feed them another brand of food (they're all indoor cats) & when I introduced them to this food, they couldn't get enough of it!  They've been eating this food EXCLUSIVELY for at LEAST 7 years now (obviously, the younger ones have been eating it for less time) & NONE of them has EVER been sick from it!\", \"I've bought them many times. Good quality and good taste, baby love it, and I love it too. Reccommend it.\", \"As a pet enthusiast, I appreciate when a manufacturer cares about the animal and not just the profits.  First Mate has their own factory and sources their products from North America. They formulate their food to be holistic, basically, what the dog needs and nothing else.  Their food is balanced and not trendy like many of the high protein diets.  Best of all...my dogs eat it!  I cannot tell you how many times I have purchased high end foods that my dogs won't go near.\", 'This was my first jug and I will re-order. It is a bit thinner than other brands I've tried, but more \"maply\" in taste. I did use Wholefoods 365 - their own brand -- which is a blend on syrups from \"the US and Canada.\"', 'I love this tea! It has a great flavor (slightly floral and even a little bit sweet). I think it is much better than other green teas. The srrength of the tea brewed through the Keurig is perfect, too. I highly recommend it.', 'When I was diagnosed with celiac disease I stopped eating bread because it tasted so bad.  My friend Lois shared the bread with me and it tasted like real bread and it was soft.  At first they were out of pamelas and I tried a different brand but it wasnt so good.  I started getting it every 2 months but Iate it so quickly I get it every month.  I am anxiously waiting for the shipment to come because I am out of the bread.', 'Great standing prime rib. meat was well pakaged and fresh. Meat was delivered early. Prime rib was so juicy...followed this recipe from paula deen, yummy...[....] Thanks so much', \"I didn't believe the hype I had heard about cacao beans until I bought them.How good they taste is a subjective question , I think they taste great. Someone who is very picky may argue they are bitter (not this brand - ALL cacao beans, by nature).  Those people who would deny the health benefits of these because of a mild bitter taste on your tongue for 20 seconds, is better off with a bag of M&M's anyway.For anyone else who eats smaller quantities of food to maintain your physique, or are on a diet etc - your really going to like these a lot. When you are ready for proof they work, try the following experiment: eat about 5 of these an hour before your usual workout. compare your performance with, and without these in your system. Then you'll know what the hype is all about.\", 'I have been a tea drinker for over 40 years.  This is the best Chai that I have every had.  Even made with water it is flavorful.', 'This is the best lemon cookie that I have ever tasted.  I bought a box at a Ross store and then never saw the product again.  I went on to Amazon and bought a case three weeks ago.  Between my friends and I they are gone.I am going to buy another case.', \"These cookies have been a special find for me since I have a problem with sugar in addition to being gluten intolerant.  The reviews range from love to hate and I would not base my purchase on them unless they were all bad but it is interesting to see the range on something I've really enjoyed and am so grateful for, being a sweets addict.  I try to keep it down to one cookie at a time but sometimes I can't resist a second one.  I think they are delicious.\", \"My husband and I have been addicted to this coffee since we first started buying it directly from the company several years ago. We love the smell, the caffeine kick and the taste. Sadly, I don't care about fair trade or organic much, but I love this coffee. We introduced it to my brother who is equally picky about coffee and he is addicted to it now. Whenever we eat out for breakfast or have coffee somewhere else, we wish we were at home drinking our coffee. Our friends all love coming over for it as well.\", \"Having been familiar with Dilmah's bagged and branded teas, I tried this one and I was not disappointed.  This is a nice full-bodied tea with a slight malty taste, not unlike a good Irish Breakfast tea.  I brew it in a IngenuiTEA maker for a perfect cup.\", \"My dogs' absolutely loves these. -And I love the fact that they are not Rawhide, but still last them a while.  They are pricey, though--so always wait until they are on sale.\", \"I have to say I was a little apprehensive to buy this product for the price, but I like to keep my K-Cup price under $0.50 and Sam's Club was sold out at the time, and I tried this.  The Fuhgeddaboudit is very strong, but that's how I like it.  Overall, I was impressed.\", \"I love this salt.  You can add it to Bragg's organic apple cider vinegar, and it will taste great.  Plus the fact that it usually cures any sickness I have quickly.  What more can I ask for.\", \"I used to eat Skittles all the time when I was 13-ish.  I had some the other day, the first time I've had Skittles in ages.  I had forgotten how good they are.  All of the flavors are great.  My personal favorite is green.I recommend this popular candy.\", 'My son and I love this bread. It even tastes better than the regular raising bread in the supermarket. It is worth the extra price.', \"I love this tea chest! I was drawn to it thinking it would be a great way to impress guests.  I always love when you're at a restaurant and they present your tea options in this way. Well not only did my guests love it but I love using it on my own. It makes me feel special! (which I realize sounds a little ridiculous but oh well.)The dark wood is beautiful and the inside is lined with green felt. This would make a great gift for any tea lover.\", 'Our \"sled dog\" buddy thinks these are the best so is always on he is best behaviour when he thinks these treats may be in his future', 'BEST SNAPPLE FLAVOR EVER MADE! I was excited when I found this on amazon since I cant find them in stores anymore! I TASTE LIKE I AM TAKING A BITE OUT OF AN ACTUAL JUICY APPLE! AMAZING!', \"This is exactly as described: delicious maple sugar, at the best price I could find anywhere.  While I abandoned my original plan for this as impractical (I wanted to attempt to make some maple rock candy), we've been enjoying this sweetener in our coffee, on our cereal, to make tasty maple kettle-corn, and with other treats.  And it's absolutely delicious as a sweetener for yerba mate (a South American herbal tea of which I'm especially fond).\", 'My 2 cats, age 14 and 15, looked at this food like, \"Where's the GOOD food!\". They had been eating Fancy Feast with gravy which is fine but contains corn and they throw up alot. They have been trowing up about 90% less on Natural Balance. They each put on about 1/2 to 1 pound. Their coats are glossy and I feel better knowing this food is alot healthier. At first, I bought some cheap tuna and had to mix the canned on a 1:1 ratio to get them to eat it, then 1:2, now 1:3 (1 can tuna to 3 cans Natural balance). I will soon wean then off the tuna but there was crying for a few days at first and my 15 year old flat out refused to eat for abot 4 days and lost a pound but finally started to nibble on it and now eats it well. The dry was better received but they need canned also. Worth the bother as now they cry when their dish is empty!!', \"I just love this supplement. It gives me tons and tons of energy, my stool is nice and soft (not too soft). I take it every day and I think it does the job perfectly. I used to not have enough energy in the morning, even after drinking coffee. But since I've been taking Natural Calm in the morning and in the afternoon I am full of energy. Even after I have lunch, I don't crush like before. I keep on going and working without problems of being tired. I just love it!!!\", \"My mom-in-law had rec'd 1 box of these in a gift box, but couldn't find more when she found she enjoyed the convenience of them in her hot tea & on toast.  She said the straws are just the right amount, they are less messy & the honey keeps longers than in a jar.  A 6-pk was a great surprise for her.  The price was reasonable for a convenience item.\", 'I enjoy the premasured packs and I am sending some to our soldiers as they find the packs better to serve them.', 'The wild rice and brown rice medley are flavorful and beautiful colors.  They have an interesting texture and look nice with other foods.  They have concise but complete cooking instructions.  All in all, a real treat.', 'I had to stop giving my  15 year old cat dry food because he could no longer hold it down (even the ones with only whole food ingredients were too hard on his system).  He would even throw up blood clots if I had to leave him with dry food for a couple of days.  His stool became loose and smelled even worse than usual.  I gave him this on a trip that I had to bring him along with me and he has been doing great on it. His stool is hard now and he holds it down.', 'The flavor of this product is great. It is not HOT as one might assume cajun products are.  Thanks for a great product.', 'I received my order (van hotte flavored coffee) quickly and it was described accurately.  Thank you  Karen Van Den Berge', 'After reading all the positive raves about these products, I decided to give them a try. Having fresh lemons and limes isn't always possible and these are excellent substitutes. I like them so much that I'll need to invest in the large shaker size for home use and save the packets for carrying in my purse. I've added these to water and various teas (both hot and cold) and for cooking. I really like the lemon sprinkled on fish. I haven't tried the grapefruit but I plan to buy some soon. I don't seem to tolerate acesulfame potassium and sucralose very well, so I've stayed away from the True Lemonade drinks.The taste of the lemon, lime, and the orange are very subtle to whatever you add them to, they truly enhance everything. They don't overpower the taste like some flavorings do.What I found surprising is that one of the product claims on their website is that these are sugar free, yet \"cane juice\" is listed last in the ingredients on each packet. I guess that's what they mean by \"no artificial sweetners\".', \"With so many different GF cookies out there, it is getting harder and harder to find a cookie that isn't just full of sugar. Eat these suckers with some water and you are set for the day!\", 'Was given a recipe by a coworker that required Hawaiian Sea Salt.  The recipe came out perfect after using this product.  Well made and well packaged.  Would recommend.', \"A normal, off the shelf pasta has about 220 calories per 2oz (dry, uncooked) serving.  Very few people actually eat JUST 2 ounces -- this is why pasta has gotten such a bad reputation in the quest to loose weight or maintain a healthy weight.  The wheat provides a small amount of protein, but unless you're eating whole wheat pasta (ik) it doesn't provide fiber.Enter Fiber Gourmet products!  That same 2oz dry serving has only 130 calories, plus it also has 18 (can you believe it?) grams of fiber.  And it isn't grainy like whole wheat pasta, or slimy like some of the low-carb things that hit the market a few years ago with the Adkins craze.  In fact, it tastes just like regular pasta.And they make it in several of the most popular shapes.  And if you go to the Fiber Gourmet site, they also make it in several popular flavors -- my favorites are the red/black pepper, the cajun, and the garlic/parsley.  They evidently also make tomato, but have been out of it every time I've gone looking.It's really good stuff.  :D  Hard to argue with 130 calories and 18g of fiber, now matter what kind of sauce or pesto you put on it!\", \"I've tried so many different teas wanting to take the healthy approach but have been shoved right back to the coffee pot due to complete lack of flavor. Tea always seemed so boring. However, this tea is so yummy I am converted. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy coffee, but I now incorporate this tea almost daily. I love the Chamomile Citrus and Green tea Tropical!! The smell is divine and the tea bags are practically a work of art... LOVES IT!!\", 'A friend gave me this herbal tea for Christmas & I was hooked immediately! It has enough natural sweetness that it does not need any sweetner added to it. I took a few packs of it to Miami to visit my son & his family & they also loved it! My daughter-in-law found it on Amazon & ordered it for her & me ! I really do drink a cup every morning! Great product & thanks to Amazon a great price!One tip for ordering: make sure you order correctly! There is a caffeine free herbal & another w/ real tea & caffeine. We accidently ordered the one w/ caffeine the first time.', 'My husband bought me a Keurig coffee maker for my birthday. I really shopped around for the lowest prices on k-cups. Amazon was the cheapest. Green Mountain coffee is one of our favorites. So we are very happy with our purchase at Amazon.', \"I love these bars and run out of them quickly. I don't feel guilty about this snack - they are tasty yet healthy.\", 'It is all about the right mixture and the better way to brew a nice cup of coffee. We add lots of hot milk to it and make out own latte. This coffee is our espresso replacement and tastes so good! It is a coffee our European visitors really appreciate.There are 2 reasons to prefer it over Starbucks, it is heck of a lot cheaper and it tastes at least as good (to me).', 'Our son likes this meal, but it is definitely something that needs to be warmed.  When it is cool or at room temperature the consistency is a little unappealing.', 'My Dog takes a few different medications, and it has been a struggle to get her to take her pills.  I have tried everything from cheese, hot dogs, etc., etc.  Thank-you Greenies for coming up with such a wonderful way for a pet to take their medication.  My dog thinks it's a treat, and has \"no idea\", she is taking medication!', \"I have been trying out different crackers and pretzels to fulfill my need for something nonsweet and crunchy that isn't too bad for me.  I think Manischewitz has a real shot at the non-bube market. Even though there is no salt added, these whole wheat matzos aren't tasteless.  I think they would sell more boxes to outsiders if they shrank the image of the crackers on the box and included a simple hummus recipe on the back of the box as a serving suggestion.  It couldn't hurt.\", 'So far, I've only used this in banana bread. And I cut it with some regular flour in probably a 70% spelt to 30% flour ratio.

It is almost \"soul cleansing.\"The taste is one that takes getting used to.I drink mine with honey.', \"If you make bread at home, you've noticed that some loaves don't hold their shape very well.  Vital Wheat Gluten solves that problem.  Use one teaspoon per cup of all purpose flour, and your bread will hold its shape better during rising and baking.

I make bread every day, and am much happier with my results wince I've begun using gluten powder in it.\", \"I am happy that I am able to get this item through Amazon.com since they no longer sell it in any of the stores.  The dispenser is not very good as others have mentioned, so I just pop off the red cap on top and take them out that way so I don't lose any to crushing in the faulty dispenser.  I just received my order today, (6 bags of 6).  I was happy that I got them so fast, although one bag of six only had five in it.  Hopefully this is a one time mistake, so I am still giving 5 stars.\", \"This brazil nut butter is better than I thought it was going to be! I personally am not a brazil nut fan, but I do love this product!! It could be added to fruit or something elese that's sweet, or it would taste good spread on bread, or even great on it's own. It doesn't have a boring taste. I recomend it.\", 'The package arrived in prior to reported delivery date!!! I just wish it was in a resealable bag. I would buy from them again even without that small issue', 'This is a 2 fold product and you must be aware of this. It is great at making me drowsy before bedtime but it is also a stool softener!

One rounded teaspoon in very warm water before bed seems to be \" my level\". Great product and service.', \"I tired this product for the first time & have tried several others over the yrs. I found this one to be very nice in both flavor & texture. It blends well & doesn't have the chalky taste many others have. I tried it w/ just water & it was okay & tried it w/ lowfat greek yogart & also w/ some fresh fruit blended in to make it more as a smoothie. I work 12 hrs shifts & sometimes having this as a meal replacement works well rather than a lot of snacks with  meal while working or for the grab & go breakfast @ 4am (mixed the night before & chilled overnight & put in water bottle).

You pay extra for the packaging, but the packaging is what counts when you're on travel.\", 'This 100% natural product for cats and dogs going through stressful times includes the same active ingredients as those for the relief of tension in some natural human formulas, like valerian and chamomile, and also apparently has a good taste, as a dropper full of the liquid in food is devoured with relish; it also includes passion flower and fructose, which is probably why it has a sweet aroma, and adds to the palatability. Other ingredients are hops, scull cap, and inert ingredients include deionized water and sodium benzoate.I've found it very useful on two occasions, once when trying to catch a young feral kitty, and secondly, to relieve the anxiety of my devoted eight year old Liddy when introducing the young cat into the household. Also good for pets that are nervous travelers, and those few animals that get upset when being groomed.Richard's Organics Pet Calm claims that it \"Treats short-term stress\", and in my situations, it has worked beautifully. Depending on the size of the dog or cat (1 dropper = 1 ml. / Up to 40 lbs., 1-4 ml. / Over 40 lbs., 3-6 ml.), there are a lot of doses in this 2 oz. bottle, and I think it's an excellent value.Liddy, Maggie and I are very satisfied customers of this product, which has made our lives easier and more peaceful.', 'These coffee beans are rich, full-bodied, and economical.  This is the second time I have ordered them, and both times, was pleased with the flavor.  I had to cut back some on the amount I used, because the coffee was almost too strong, even though I like strong coffee.  There was no bitterness or after-taste.  I highly recommend this product.', \"These are by far my favorite chips, they are extremely crunchy (similar to other Kettle style chips), but it's the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks.

But, at 150 calories and 89 cents per serving on Amazon subscribe & save, this is not too much of a bargain. For the occasional cup of cocoa this fits the bill, but if you have children around who like to drink a lot of cocoa and invite their friends over for it, this can get pricey.

However, these cookies are just so delicious that I cannot put them down! I love how the frosting is not just sugar, but also has a butter cream vanilla taste. It tastes like cake. The sprinkles add just the right amount of crunchiness before you bite into the entire cookie. As you chew, the cookie turns into a mouth watering sweet buttery cake dough. This is why I need to watch myself and count the cookies as I eat, to prevent over eating! Though they all taste the same, I am personally more attracted to the pink ones =) So glad I can get these cookies at Wal-mart!I do not recommend buying this online, just because when it gets hot, the cookies tend to stick together. It is annoying having a double-cookie because they will not separate without breaking. Also, always store in a cookie place!

I have tried other brands such as Yogi and Twinings. I did not like the Yogi brand at all (yuck!), the Twinings' brand while not disgusting taste like lemon tea with a 'hint' of ginger. I have tasted other brands that have a stronger ginger taste than Stash but they've also had a strange taste to them as well so so far Stash is my favorite.

When I found sellers in Amazon selling it I bought a box of six mixes. Baked in sheet cake form, with whipped cream for frosting and mandarin orange segments placed on top, it was as good as I remember with a noticeable flavor of orange, and the anticipated moistness Duncan Hines delivers. It is a rare treat to enjoy once again, and the price seemed reasonable enough. With only me to enjoy them, the six boxes had better last a year or two.', 'These are good, but the noodles are not much different than cheap Maruchen Ramen.

OK so maybe some niche market limited production chocolate is better, but hey what we can buy from Amazon this chocolate is really good.  Great pains are taken to ensure the package arrives with its delicate cargo intact.  They are packaged in styro-foam insulating boxes inside cardboard boxes.  I think they are shipped 1 day delivery, but if it is hot, the chocolates may arrive slightly deformed.  This did not detract from the taste.

SMILEMoreover, there are no additives nor are there preservatives. You can use these tea bags a very long time after you bought them in a store or here at Amazon.com online.Yes, you can serve this tea iced with lemon; but I normally find it most useful for those nasty winter months when I inevitably catch a miserable cold.

I add milk and one packet of \"sweet and low\" and it's absolutely delicious!You can use a tea bag twice if you wish but after two uses the tea bag has probably served its' \"tour of duty.\"Overall, this is a fine quality tea that will not over stimulate you with caffeine.

It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.  The combined effect is aromatic and slightly spicy (not as spicy as regular chai tea).  You can add milk and sugar to make this tea creamier and more similar to traditional chai, but I prefer to drink it plain, as I think it's perfect as is.

To be honest myself, our dog does not really like the taste of this food (but there were many kibbles she did not like either). We do need to add some boiled meats or something tempting for her to eat the whole bowl, but the healthy outcome is worth it. Our vet initially thought our dog had food allergies, I really think she is just sensitive to processed foods. She can eat most proteins; beef and salmon in limited amounts.

Somehow \"Hungry Jack\" felt like an afront to such a sublime kitchen appliance. I read the reviews here on Amazon and concluded that despite the rather high price, Stonewall would be a great choice. Bang! Nailed it the first time. Now, I don't know if my waffle maker is particularly large/deep, but I get only two and one half waffles out of each batch (following the recipe on the label). I don't dare water it down to try to stretch it out and I figure I only got about 10 batches of waffles out of one can. The cost-per-waffle is steep, but these have never failed to come out light on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside, and they have NEVER stuck to the waffle iron.

I have both the dry and canned and she begs and can't wait for me to put the bowl down with the canned food in it.  After a week of new food and medicine she had gained almost a pound and is doing much better.  Her coat is soft and she is very active.

They come out crisp and lightly browned and are absolutely delicious with a little lemon sprinkled over them. My family loves them every time I serve them. It's the only coating I have used for years. I just hope Amazon will have them back in stock soon as they are the cheapest place I have found them so far.

I wish I could tell you it will help you lose weight, but of course it doesn't promise that. But it is a very nice gum to chew when you are looking for something sweet.  The flavor lasts a longer time than other gums. I'd say it is fairly strong the first half hour of chewing, then still has some flavor even after that, though it is milder.As others have mentioned this apple pie flavor is hard to find for me too. I sometimes find single packs, high-priced, but it is almost impossible to find the multipacks. I sure hope they don't eliminate this flavor or these dessert gums because they are great.I suggest you try the other flavors too: key lime pie, strawberry shortcake, orange creme, etc. I have never seen the rainbow sherbet around here or the root beer float, but I just bought the root beer here on Amazon to try and will write a review after trying it.Oh, and if you are an aunt it is your obligation and duty to always carry gum for your nieces and nephews.\", 'My husband loves these noodles.

Additionally, we've all ordered several of the Buffalo Bills brands and they're all superb!

It is pricey but if you are able to taste the difference in water taste this will put a smile on your face and a smile from your body as you drink it. Volvic comes from france with a perfect balance of mineral flavors. I have difficulty drinking straight water as most bottled water has no taste and is just wet like poland spring. I can drink volumes of volvic water easily due to the great refreshing taste. I cannot do that with tasteless water like poland spring and fiji waters. Fiji is also expensive but it is just a fancy bottle with tasteless water. Cost does not guarantee quality taste. If you have never experienced the taste of a good water you will if you try this. Always chill volvic for best results before drinking in the bottle it came in. Addition of ice not originated from volvic may alter the taste. The flavor of good water comes from the mineral content and volvic has a perfect blend. EnjoyP.s. You can find it cheaper at whole foods', 'I have a 22-month old son who loves everything dinosaur.

It can be difficult to find single origin chocolate, but they have several options.  The processing is just right, the darks are dark and rich, not too sweet or bitter, and not overly filled with waxes and cocoa butter the way many others are.  The natural profiles of the chocolate shine through, gently supported by the minimal addition of sugar and vanilla.  My favorite is the Dos Rios, it's fruity with just a little spice, but earthy enough without being dirty or musky.  Because the chocolate is so rich I eat it very slowly--half a square is plenty in one sitting, and I usually only want it once or twice a week.  A bar is worth every cent, even when I find myself giving much of it away (because really, you have to try this...)\", 'Use all flavors to flavor food without calories and sugar.

He *loves* this bone, and it is the only bone he has repeatedly gone back to over the years (and believe me, this spoiled dog has been able to sample just about every bone ever made).

I finally just bought him his 2nd bone a few weeks ago, and the original one is probably still a third of its original size.  He chews on it 5-6 nights every week, while the rest of his bones collect dust.  I can't recommend it enough, especially for those \"power chewers\".  I don't know what they do to the bones to retain the flavor, but it works!  Don't let the expensive price tag fool you--they last for years.Update 10/5/10: Believe it or not, my dog still loves this bone!

I'd give it 4 stars, because I think the price is a bit steep.  At close to $4.00 per 4 ounce bag it's nearly as expensive as beef jerky I buy for myself.

And now we have something that can be sprinkled over greek-style non-fat plain yogurt, which he IS supposed to be eating more of.

I'm not on a gluten-free diet, but I have friends who are, and this product would be just fine for them. The mix of whole grains has an interesting texture and taste, and the whole blend tastes so good I'd warn you not to sit down with the whole bag in front of the TV. It WILL be gone before you know it.Cost is my only problem with this product, but not because it's not worth the money. Healthy food costs more than junk, as it should, and it's clear to me that Kind is very healthy indeed. We're on low fixed income, though, so this would have to be an occasional splurge item for us, used more as a condiment on aforementioned yogurt than as a complete meal. I can stretch $5 worth of beans or chicken a lot further than I could one of these 11 oz. bags.

Rich, Flavorful, and at a bargin.To get to the point, fusion sea salt has great truffle flavor at half the price of the other brands. It is great for anyone who is new to truffles, and doesn't want to spend $30 for something they may OR may not like...but I'm pretty sure you'll be back, and you may even find yourself spending that little extra, for a little more of that special ingredient.\", 'I admit it! I am a coffee drinker all day long so I was excited to try this new blend.  It smelled great brewing and when I tasted it I liked the flavor.  Mild and not too acidity it really hit the spot. Some coffees can leave a nasty bitter after taste and I was pleased to see it was not so with this one. My husband also had some of this coffee and really liked it. If you are a coffee drinker give this one a try. It has a good flavor that you will enjoy.', \"I have Via in the morning now instead of grinding and brewing fresh beans. I end up saving because in the past i can't finish the pot and end up being wasteful. These are a PERFECT replacement, and were actually better than my fresh roasted beans from my local coffee shop.

I have made cookies using this and the Rapunzel sugar (also low) and the taste is heavenly.  In fact, I made some black bean chocolate cookies that are a big rave and have only 1 Weight Watcher point each.  Just search for Black Bean chocolate cookies and substitute the two sugars mentioned above for the bad kind.  We are also gluten free here, so I used coconut flour and cocoa powder for part of the flours - very high protein and fiber.  Good luck everyone and enjoy!', 'My cats rush to get a treat as they think this product is extremely delectable. This is one one of their favorite foods.', \"I just tried these for the first time in a low fat, low carb, healthy Shirataki Chow Mien dish. These are fantastic for Asian style dishes. The texture would not work at all for Western style noodle dishes like Spaghetti, I think, but I don't even feel the need to try because they are so good used in the cuisine they were meant for.As far as the fishy smell many people complain about, I didn't have any issues with this. I rinsed them off while I was preping the veggies, and they didn't have any smell AT ALL after that.I will definitely be buying more of these!\", 'This is a really good tea.

Awesome stuff. You'll only be sorry when they are gone and you have eaten too much.\", \"When I 1st tried this, I really didn't like it just by itself. But then in stead of putting just all water, I put 1tsp of sugar free coffee syrup and 2tsp of water and it made it taste so much better.

It's not overly sweet, has a wonderful cinnamon flavor, with wonderful clusters that are not saturated with spices, and just enough almonds for crunchiness.  Just a perfect blend of flavor and raisins!  Raisin Bran has always been one  of my favorites and this one is definitely at the top of the list.  A wonderful improvement, the box barely made it two days in this house.  Highly, highly recommend!\", \"Royal Dansk cookies have always been a great cookie and they continue to be.

While it may not be the mustard you'd want for everyday recipes and is by no means the subtle mustard you'd want with many sandwiches it shines when it comes time to BBQ. Using this mustard when you BBQ chicken/hamburgers/Turkey burgers(especially) and about any marinade you'd use mustard for is a real treat. There is a somewhat pungent quality to the mustard that while it smells somewhat unpleasant when you first open it, it cooks extremely well.

The due date (time it should be used up) was about 2 and a half months from time I received it.  (So plan on using this product fairly often.)  Now, as to analysis, I don't have to eat wheat free, gluten free food, so my bias here is toward taste and nutrition.  As to taste, I tried it in my sourdough waffles that I make, substituting the flour for the usual wheat flour and leavening agents (my original recipe called for baking soda, salt, and baking powder--apparently all are in this product), and the waffles turned out just as good if not better than the wheat ones.  I also tried it in the chocolate chip cookie recipe on the package, and I like those cookies better than the original wheat one. The taste is slightly different (I'm sorry, I can't quite put my finger on the difference.)  The cookies tend to be a little more moist and slightly thicker. I plan on trying more of the recipes on the back (there are at least 6 recipes on the back of the package). Nutrition wise, it's a mixed bag; you can't directly compare wheat flour to this mix as the mix has a lot of our minor things like salt which taint the analysis.  Calorie wise, it looks like the mix has more calories (but not a large difference).  To sum up, I really like the product for taste.  If you HAVE to have a gluten free product, I think it is a great alternative.\", \"Meow Mix original is THE ONLY DRY CAT FOOD my kitties will eat, ever! I've made the mistake of picking up the wrong flavor and would end up having to go back to the store and buy the original.  I do mix the wrong one with the original but the portions have to be tons more original than different flavor. My kitties are filled out well, their coats are so heavenly soft and shiny. Being able to have it shipped to my door saves me so much in not having to drag the big bag around getting it home.  Thank You, Jill Hahn\", \"I first found these at Costco but we go through them so quickly I get the single flavors by the case with AMazon's monthly delivery service. Dried apple is our favorite. They were great for my now 18 month old when he was first starting to eat solid foods... convenient I could throw a pack in my purse, he could easily eat them without making amess (one of the few foods he could eat without making a mess).. my 3YO loves them too... teachers at day care were even asking where we get them. My mom got other brands but we came back to this one.\", \"This brown sugar is nothing less than terrific.  It has a wonderful flavor and isn't sickeningly sweet like the regular brown sugar brands sold in supermarkets.  Once it warms up to room temperature it softens up.\", \"This seasoning is the very best seasoning that I have ever found.It adds so much flavor to everything.It's great on hamburgers,sandwiches,soups and just about anything else.I don't understand why more grocery stores don't carry it.Morton should do a better job of marketing this product.I bought the 6 pack from Amazon at a great price.I hope they never run out because I am a lifelong customer.\", \"I begin my day with one cup of smooth move tea-- everyday.  If I forget I make sure that I take it before I go to bed at night. It taste good. My teenaged grandsons like it.It depends on how blocked you are which will determine how it works.  You may have to have two cups before it begins to work. However, make sure you do not have any place to go when you are trying it out for the first time.  Believe me it will work. Some people it takes time others it works right away. I use it once a day and it keeps me regular. It dosn't run because I know how to use it. I have been doing this for some time--for four years. I steep it for one minute if I kept it in for more than 1-5 minutes I would not be able to go out because it would run. My friend steeps it for 1/2 a minute that way she is able to go out. Give it five days before you give up on it. So good luck to you all.\", 'Butterfinger hot chocolate is very good. It taste like a butterfinger candy bar.

It's not the sloppy, gooey, half chewed stuff you think of as oat meal from your childhood. It's nutty and chewey and tasty.

She kept stealing mine so I had to get her some of her own.The packaging states it has nutrients for the scalp and the hair and I believe it.

Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.

Just like the ones I had in the store. I made the whole bag because it was about 1 1/2 cups.

I tried some grain free, and noticed some problems from the cats.  I tried going all wet - but apparently - my 17 yo needs some of the grains in dry food,  Their main food of choice (I'm not much of one for switching - had trouble with Turkey and Salmon flavors) is <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0\">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>.I started with this Dry when it was Eagle Pack Holistic Select.  The formula was EU certified (which has a higher degree of ingredient integrity than US pet foods).  Since then, this company merged with the new owners of Wellness - so the 2 brands can compliment each other.The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.EDIT: 3/24/2011I've switched some things up since the Wellness problems (and still waiting for Wellness Chicken Recipe to Return).I have started rotation feeding wet food, and have found that I use less dry food than before - here is my general shopping list:<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY\">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.

However, cats have reacted positively to this food).<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0\">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.This is why I prefer the smaller bag.  Except for the removal of additional Vitamin K (google on that one), the ingredients haven't changed much since I started in 2008 (when it was EU certified).

This soup is slightly salty as are most of them, but if you add more water than directed it's not bad at all. For a soup that only takes 1 1/2 min. to make in a microwave and tastes like chicken noodle soup, its excellent. I did not need a spoon to get the noodles and chicken out of my cup, it just slid out with the liquid.

You know how Coke tastes great, and Walmart  Cola tastes okay, if you had to drink it instead of Coke you would live, right? Well these soda flavors are like three notches below the generic sodas at the store. Like I mentioned, they all have some weird flavor.Except the Energy drink. WOW, if you like Red Bull, then you are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It's like the flavor of Red Bull, bumped up ten times. Plus, I'd say it gives me more energy than Red Bull. Okay, not energy, but the shakes and the so-alert-I-may-explode feeling. It makes me so jittery, IF I drink a lot of it, that I can't think straight and my heart is pounding.

It is a little bitter as most stronger coffees are, but not too too bitter.  I would say it leans towards strong on the medium to strong scale, but it's not overwhelming.  If you like a nice normal blend with some kick, and are an advocate of organic initiatives, this is a great pick.I also like to say that I always look to buy the good Newman's Own brands when I can based on the fact that the Newman's Own Foundation continues Paul Newman's commitment to donate all profits to charity.

Doing that makes it better than the K cup version. I happen to like very strong coffee and this vue cup experience may be unique to me. Tully's regular vue cup size is stong enough for me however.  I like the Donut Shop Vue Cup travel mug size sufficient to have set up automatic monthly delivery. I might add that I still order Tully's French Roast for an even stronger non-bitter brew.

Not at all gritty, no funny tastes (which is his complaint on some of the gluten free breads).  We make one cookie sheet size pizza from one package of this mix.

I highly recommend it.', \"I can't tell you how many times I have switched my 8 week old son's formula.  We have tried Enfamil Newborn, AR, and Gentlease, we have tried Baby's Only Soy, Dairy and Similac Alimentum.  Every single one caused my baby some kind of problem, from spitting up to  constipation, gas, and pain while eating.  At 5 weeks he was diagnosed with silent reflux and put on rantidine three times a day.  I did not want to give him prescription drugs at 5 weeks old, but I thought I would try it.  He was in so much pain, it was awful to watch.  It was also affecting his sleep because he could not lie flat without having pain.To make a long story short, the rantidine did nothing to help his reflux.  After two weeks I decided to call it quits.  My pediatrician gave me samples of Alimentum because we suspected a milk protein allergy.  The Allimentum did no good and gave him diarrhea.  I switched back to Gentlease, even though it produced horrible green swamp poops and did not really help anything either.  I almost gave up looking for a good formula, assuming that they were all horrible.We tried everything I could find.  First we bought a probiotic and started that once a day.  It seemed to help aid digestion but did nothing to ease his pain.  Then we switched from Avent to Dr. Brown's bottles, which cut down on the gas and helped a little bit more.  Finally, I decided to give this formula a try.  I was in the middle of a feeding of Gentlease, and he was crying in pain.  Just for kicks I popped open a can of the Baby's Only Lactorelief and BAM!  No pain!  He literally stopped crying right in the middle of the feed, gulped down 4 ounces, and crashed.I did not realize until visiting the NaturesOne website that they do compare this formula to Enfamil Gentlease and Similac Sensitive.  It's the only sensitive organic formula on the market.  The ingredients are similar to that of the other brands but it does not contain corn or hexane-derived DHA/ARA.  It smells and tastes a ton better.I don't think my son is lactose intolerant.  Or maybe he is.  There are also theories out there that some babies are sensitive to corn or DHA.  Whatever the problem, I don't care.  After two days of eating this formula, the only time we are experiencing any discomfort is when he has to burp.  Even that seems very minimal and the burps are easier to coax out.  I always wondered how long I should wait to see results from a new formula.  A day?  A week?  A month?  In this case, I have seen improvement from the very first feed.  I won't say it's perfect yet, but he may have inflammation from the previous formula.  I will update.I know how frustrating it can be to figure out what the problem is if your baby is having reflux issues.  It's trial by fire until you nail something down.  If you are feeding Enfamil Gentlease or Similac Sensitive and would prefer an organic alternative, this is for you.  Please do not let these people who insist that the arsenic will hurt your baby scare you.  Do some research on hexane and DHA and decide which is worse, potential small amounts of arsenic (which is naturally occurring from volcanic activities in the areas of the world where rice is grown) or the hexane derivation process.  This is the ONLY formula on the market which does not contain DHA/ARA.Yes, it's expensive.  But so are Alimentum and Nutramigen, and if your baby needs it, it's worth its weight in gold.  I'm so glad it's working for us, and I could not be happier with it.Update 9-14-12Still working great!  After two weeks, it's almost like my son never had reflux at all!  We still get the occasional feed where he has an episode, but I think that might be stomach related and since he can't tell me, I'll never know.  It seems to help to burp thoroughly when he gets that way.Update 10-3-12Over a month later we are still loving this formula.  I had an extra can of the Dairy formula lying around and wanted to use it up.  It instantly gave my son horrible gas and an upset stomach.  I think he really does have a lactose sensitivity.  I'm so glad Nature's One makes this organic lactose-free formula.  My son is growing and thriving on it, with no reflux issues to speak of.\", 'The lady bugs were very Cute, a great size, they were packaged well, they tasted great and came when it said it would!', 'I used butter instead of the margarine called for, added more chocolate chips (1/2 cup) and the results were amazing.

I used to buy it at Whole Foods but they do not carry it any longer. Whole Foods sold it at a much better price so paying so much more for it plus shippping is not too cool.

I grant you that letting it sit for awhile is the hardest part there are many times that I am so thrilled with this concotion that I consume it on the spot.  sometimes I find myself standing up and eating it all, well most of it.  Of course you can do what you want afterall it's your tuna, but you could put it on salad greens as well or share it with someone.  that's the nice part, they will love it, or you, or both,  thats for sure.\", \"Thanks so much for the peppermint mocha flavor.

My husband made me hide them from him because he quickly polished off about 8 of them and he wanted to make them last!Also, our order was received three days ahead of the estimated time to ship them so that was a big plus.My hubby was thrilled because the company also threw in a free sample pack of honey pepper jerky as a thanks ( the price of which covered the shipping and handling charge, so I feel like I got a good deal).Completely pleased with this product!\", 'I love this delicious tea!  It is a perfect combination of spices, and even if I forget to remove the bag right away (like I just did now) it does not get bitter.

It was easy to prepare by soaking in water for 15 minutes then frying it up with some spices, tomato, onion and garlic in a bit of olive oil.  The texture is close to ground beef though not exactly the same, just a bit softer.  I think I like this product the best of the various protein replacements I've tried.  My only complaint and it's minor, is that it tastes slightly sweet.  Perhaps more experimentation with it and I can figure out how to offset this.  In any event I'll be ordering more!\", \"These are by far the best saltine crackers I've eaten.  They are light and airy and have just the right amount of salt.

I was just in Maui, where the product runs anywhere from $25-$27 for 12oz whole bean. When asking grocers at local stores which of the kona coffee is best, they all said \"Wings of the Morning\". I must say I fell in love with kona coffee when trying this brand. I went to their website & found they sell the product for $22 without the cloth bag, & price decreases as you buy more. The shipping is $10 2 day fed ex for 1st package, $2.00 for 2nd, $2 for next 5. They also roast the beans per order!

I refrigerated it since I prefer to drink my water cold and then also pour it over ice.  What can I tell you?  I don't think it's my imagination when I tell you that it does taste smooth.  It is refreshing and even though I am not a big water drinker I would choose this product again if I had a chance to buy it.Therefore I give it a recommend to buy.\", \"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  I was so happy to find a 10-lb box of it.  Yes, it came in a plastic bag with a twist tie, but they could have delivered it in a wheelbarrow and I would have been happy.  My bag did weigh a full 10 pounds and there was no powder residue outside of it, so mine was apparently better sealed than the other reviewers' bags.  My only caution, if you have a milk, peanut or tree nut allergy, then this product is not safe for you.\", \"This product is a staple at our house. My family loves it. If you are a fan of dirty rice and beans or black beans in general, I think you will like it too. Prepare according to package directions. I add a chopped onion and 1/2 pound of Echrich Smoked Beef sausage, diced. If you want to stretch it even further, add a handful of rice. Everything goes in the pot at the same time. In 25 minutes it is ready to eat. It serves as a hearty main dish for three or as a side dish for a larger family. This is a mildly spicy dish. A few dashes of Tabasco will kick it up for those that like it hot.I was thrilled to see Vigo Black Beans and Rice on Amazon's grocery list. Where I live, this product is hard to find. Amazon had a great price too!\", 'Wow... I was so happy to try this pasta for the first time, it tasted just like regular pasta!

I don't have one of those expensive, pod-using, coffeemakers.  I do have a single mug coffeemaker, which I normally fill with water using the provided fourteen ounce mug.  For the purposes of this product, I tried just putting in a cup (8 oz) of water, and placing the pod in the basket.  This produced a weak, undrinkable liquid.  The second time, I filled the pot with 8 oz. again.  I cut open two of the pods and put the coffee in the usual No. 2 filter.  This produced a very strong, but very delicious cup of coffee.  I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.  Filling the one-cup coffeemaker with the usual full mug of water and the contents of two opened pods makes a slightly weaker but still very full-bodied, rich coffee.\", 'If you bake frequently, you can save enough money in a very few months by not buying yeast in little foil envelopes to buy a pretty nice bottle of wine.Active dry yeast will keep almost indefinitely when frozen, so you'll need something to keep it in.

This product does not have the effect of a hypnotic or a benzodiazepine, so one should not expect it to \"knock you out.\" Rather, I do experience a noticeable \"lightening\" of the muscles. As I lie in bed, I feel more comfortable and better able to focus on feeling comfortable because the muscles all throughout my body seem to be content to be in \"off\" mode; they are not as easily excitable as they are on my previously magnesium-deficient diet.I am pleased with this product and will continue taking two teapoons in water every night.

This rice saw my wife and me through a diet revision program (Dr. Stephen J. Gislason's \"Alpha Nutrition Program\" for diabetes control or IBS). After a few days of no food we faced weeks of gradually adding more and more \"dangerous\" foods back into our diet and observing the results. The first food we were allowed was this parboiled basmati rice with soft cooked vegetables like zucchini, carrots, broccoli, and peas. Frankly, those meals were delicious and felt good. I still enjoy many meals of this basmati rice. I tried to switch to a cheaper \"long-grain\" rice but it was gritty and tasteless by comparison.

About a week ago I've been giving him Nutro Ultra and the much smaller size of his kibble makes it a lot easier for him to chew.

There are NO artificial ingredients - and there is NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP and NO CORN SYRUP!  They use REAL SUGAR and that's huge.

I purchased these through Amazon as the seller, which eliminated the shipping and handling charge with my Prime membership. I guess that experience with the damaged shipping sort of scared Amazon away from selling it again, because now, the chicken stock is no longer available from them. I have to use a different seller=pay shipping/handling. If they think I'm going to pay 22+ plus the $13 shipping when I just got the beef stock for a little over $22.00, well that's just not going to happen!This is not to degrade this seller(Bangella, I think it is).

The price is in line with the others, too, while some brands charge more just for the brand name.Buying bulk at Amazon sure beats the tiny 12 packs at the grocery store. There is nothing worse for a coffee drinker than running out of morning coffee!I like most of Newman's other products, finding them better than the other comparable products at the local chain grocery stores, and the coffee is also equal or better than the competition in terms of quality and taste. Their buyers, tasters, and marketers are obviously doing something right.A large percentage of Newman's profits all goes to charity, too.So if you love Newman's sauces and dressings, and like Starbucks coffees, you will love Newman's Coffee.\", 'I absolutely love this product!

The chocolate ones are good too if you are a chocoholic (which I am not so they are too sweet for me). They also have mini bars, of which I have only tried the cookie dough - it too is very sweet and perfect size for a snack. I recommend ThinkThin products with every thread of my being and with all my taste buds this is an A++ bar!\", 'I have enjoyed the apple drink very much, especially on cold afternoons, or a late evening \"snack\".  I still drink it but not as often in hot weather.  I find that ordering it by the 3-box amount is very convenient.Thanks for carrying it.I purchased this at Amazon.com', 'I agree that this is the best hot chocolate that I've ever had.  Most other flavors and brands are either too watery or not chocolately enough.  Unfortunately, as of Jan. 2010, it looks like Nestle has stopped making this.  It is no longer shown on their website.  I've tried their new \"Dark Chocolate\" flavor and it is too bitter for my taste.  It is NOT a replacement for the Double Chocolate Meltdown.  I encourage everyone to call Nestle and ask them to bring back this flavor!  And if future reviewers care to suggest other similar brands, that would be helpful.  Without the Double Chocolate Meltdown, I may never drink hot chocolate again (and I really need it on cold days; I'm not a coffee drinker).', \"I recently tried these at Expo West and they are amazing!  More flavorful than any candy bar on the market and full of healthy omega-3's, protein and fiber.  This is one product worth the price.\", \"I bought this as a very special Christmas gift for my parents.  My father had seen a similar model in action visiting friends and went on and on about it.  Imagine how excited I was to find it here for less than half the price I could buy it in Canada!!!  I was very excited to give it to them and hoped it lived up to the hype.  It totally did.  They LOVE it.  They have coffee all the time now.  It's very easy to use, clean and makes consistently excellent coffee with plenty of crema.  I expected to see crema on espresso shots, but I'm talking a good head of it on a cup of coffee.  It's so amazing that my dad now makes a coffee for my mom at the first sound of her moving in bed in the morning, which he has never, ever done in the past.  It totally lived up to all the hype and is well worth the money.  Couldn't be happier!\", 'We found this on a shelf in Whole Foods, Palo Alto, CA.  Made in Somerville, MA, we wanted to support my home state and purchased this.  Needing to fill 4 gift bags for our single friends, we wanted something scrummy and nutritious - and this fit the bill.  We have not looked back.  We constantly add it to gift baskets and care packages.  Our personal favorite is the Arrabbiata Sauce. The product is good; the love story behind the company is fun; the containers are fabulous for re-use!  Good people with a good product deserve to be supported and praised.

Highly recommended.', \"I am gluten intolerant, so my choice in chips is limited, not to mention that most of the gluten-free chips don't taste that good.  These chips are truly delicious.  Of course they're not health food, but what chips are?  And they're not organic either, but I've never found a chip that is gluten-free and organic that tastes really good.  I have to say that I love these chips.  I've tried some of the other flavors by the same company, and by far the Sea Salt is my favorite.\", \"I bought this for my partner's 60th birthday. Of course, she had fun seeing all this stuff again - though she said that some of it does not look familiar, probably because it wasn't marketed in NY. Our 11 year old son also enjoyed picking out his dessert from it every day and so did all our elderly friends! I found it funny that all this candy has Nutrition Facts on it, something it didn't when it was first manufactured! We called it the box 'o fun, we loved it so much. A lot of the stuff has peanut butter in it so be careful!\", \"After trying a sample with my new Keurig it was by far my favorite tea.I looked for it at a lot of stores and couldn't find it..... ta da !............

I have only tried the Vanilla, but will happily order other flavors.\", \"I got auto ship on this product, every two months i get four boxes(40packs)i love oatmeal it's one off my favorite meals.\", \"I'm glad I took a chance on this and gave more weight to the more recent positive reviews. The pieces all arrived in tact and in good condition, and they all fit together properly.As one other person mentioned, it helps if you enjoy the process of pouring the water, waiting, and pouring again. I do enjoy the process, but I also really don't think it takes that long. The water starts draining and dripping almost immediately.I've been looking for an alternative to my french press as part of my ongoing efforts to avoid brewing coffee in a machine that is made of either plastic or aluminum. This absolutely fits the bill.\", 'The purple sticky rice from Barry Farms is very flavorful. The only complaint is the lack of cooking instructions. The first time I cooked it, I used instructions from the Lotus Black Rice package, assuming it would be similar. The rice was still hard, even after 45 minutes of simmering. At that point, we gave up on the timing & just ate it \"crunchy.\" It was very tasty-even with the crunch. I used 1 cup rice, 14oz water with just under a 1/4cup honey & some butter added to the water (during cooking not after.) Everyone in the family loved it, even our son who hates rice. My husband calls it a wonderful breakfast rice, though I think it would make a good dessert rice as well. In our case, we add it to fresh crookneck squash with minced garlic, bacon bits (real not imitation), butter, nature seasoning and 3 tablespoons of water \"steamed\" in the microwave for 4-5 minutes, then add cheese after cooking and \"poured\" over the rice. The sweet and salty mix tastes excellent and seems to please even the most finicky of eaters. (At least in our household!!)For \"real\" cooking instructions for Purple Sticky Rice I found them under a different sub-vendor of Amazon:Rinse well. Place 1 cup rice and 2 cups unsalted water in pan, bring to a boil, cover, and simmer on low for 40 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 10 minutes. One cup dry yields 2 cups cooked.(Thank you Angelina's Gourmet for putting the instructions on Amazon!!! She sells the Purple Sticky rice in larger packaging-10 lb and 25 lbs for those who like to stock up.[ http://www.amazon.com/Purple-Sticky-Rice-Bag-Each/dp/B000RHUYAM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1346527950&sr=8-2&keywords=purple+sticky+rice ] I can't attest to the flavor, as I haven't purchased it yet, but it should be the same, just in a larger package, $15.35 for 10/lbs+12.95 shipping at the time this review was written. 10 lbs is a bit much for me, but I'd admit an excellent price!', \"This is my favorite cereal! But hard to find. Not one store in Culpeper, VA carries it! I'm so glad Amazon has it! I highly reccommend it! Very filling breakfast, keeps you satisfied 'til lunch!

I have bought them different treats from time to time and some will like them and some of my cats won't.  Then I bought \"Greenies\" and all my cats love them, even Freeway.  He got his name because he was found on the Freeway by Caltrans, he was just a kitten.  Needless to say he is very timid but \"Greenies\" has brought him out of his shell.  He even takes them from my fingers.  I keep the \"Greenies\" in a cupboard under the TV and all the cats come running from everywhere if they hear that cupboard door open.  I feel like the Pied Piper with \"Greenies\".  My best friend loves her cats too so I gave her some \"Greenies\" for them.  My cats. Toes, Ralf.

All my freinds and family love the taste that the coconut oil gives the popcorn.  I picked up a 2oz cookie scoop that I use to get it out.

I do have to say that I am sort of hurt that the day after I ordered it the price went down by 4 dollars.', \"My dog's vet sells the product.  It keeps my dog's teeth white and clean.

They were on clearance ay my local CVS for $1. I wish I had bought them all!The cinnamon and brown sugar flavor is perfect together with the roasted almond flavor. It is not candy coated like other cinnamon almonds (making it a much healthier treat). Everyone that I have shared them with think that they arephenomenal! I highly recommend this product. It is one of the most tasty and healthy snacks you can find. I only wish Amazon would put them on their subscribe and save program.', \"Our extended family goes through a lot of tea and we have some genuine aficionados; some may even say snobs.  We originally tried Newman's Own tea because we liked their other products and appreciate their charitable giving ethos.  What we were expecting, at the price we paid, was a relatively low-grade, re-branded tea.  That is not what we got.What we got was not only a consistently high quality tea, but also an astonishing value.  What really impresses me is that the quality and taste of this tea is so consistent; it's really the best black tea you can find, box after box, for the price anywhere near where they sell it, even much higher.  To be honest, I don't know how they do it but I'm delighted they do.  We buy this tea by the case.The flavor of this tea is crisp and clear, rich, but never bitter.  I had been accustomed to have my tea English-style with cream, but Newman's Own black tea is so flavorful and mellow I've taken to having it straight up all the time.  It's really that good.It would be a tremendous value as it is, but throw in the fact that it is organic, to boot, and it's just a steal.  All the bags in the box are individually wrapped. Personally, I would prefer if they were loose; even though we recycle all the little paper bags they come in, I would feel better if they didn't have those at all.Easy to give this product an enthusiastic five stars.  Highly recommended.\", 'I bake bread regularly and have found this to be the best yeast.  It is used by the professionals and the results are always consistent.

Every once in awhile I get a craving for chocolate, and today was that day.  I tore open the bag, and grabbed a handful.The granola itself is slightly sweet, with just a hint of saltiness.  Exactly how I like my granola, but the chocolate was the real surprise!  It was rich and melted in my mouth.  Not really the sweetness of milk chocolate, but not the bitterness of dark chocolate either, but a very nice in between.You get six 12 ounce packages for $21.57 or about $3.60 a bag.  That seems to be about the price for natural, organic cereals, so this is an average deal.  That said, I would certainly buy this for my family as a snack.

So when I found this brand I was very pleased. It tastes great and did I mention it has zero fat? Oh yeah, I did. But each service (28 oz) only has 50 calories, no carbs and some good protein. Switch to this brand/style. You won't be displeased.\", \"I recently got a miniature Australian Shepherd puppy, and he's been teething a lot due to his baby teeth coming in.I'd read that rawhide is generally not recommended, as it can upset a dog's stomach. I read statements by Cesar Milan and others that bully sticks were preferable to rawhide.These bully sticks are great!  My puppy seems to prefer them to his chew toys as his number one chewing item...  He will chew on one for an hour, and it seems to help his teething and some anxiety. They do have a slight smell, but nothing overpowering, and his strong preference for them makes it well worth it. They also seem to last a very long time (after a week or so, we are still on the first stick, and it looks to last at least another week or two).I did notice today that on rare occasions, the dog can pull at thr side of the strip and get a stringy bit that's probably more than he should swallow...  This very rarely happens (ive only seen it once in a week), but it goes without saying, if possible keep an eye on the dog while he's chewing on these, just in case.\", 'My mother and I ate some butter crisp similar to this product.

It has a soothing rich flavor and is great on pancakes. Organic is a must for us. The price seems to be lower than its competitors.', 'I recently purchased a Vienna Superautomatica as an inexpensive second espresso maker. The first thing I noticed is that it is Italian made like many of the great espresso machines. The body of the Vienna is \"graphite\" plastic, and while it does not feel first class, it somehow has a pretty sturdy feel to it. I also like that the footprint is pretty small thus taking up little counter space.I opened the manual, which is not particularly clear, but need not be on account of very simple operation. The Vienna has three buttons--on/off, coffee, and steam. It also has a steamer control knob and a water volume knob.I turned on the machine after filling the coffee and water tanks. The buttons feel Italian--you'll know what I mean if you've owned an Alfa Romeo. They are a bit clunky next to my old Capresso C1000, but they work well (for now).The Vienna takes a couple of minutes to warm up--I don't mind this for reasons I'll reveal in a minute. The coffee spout is adjustable up and down to accommodate a large variety of cups and mugs. Once it's ready, the coffee light stops blinking. I push the button and it begins to grind the coffee. The noise level of the machine is louder than my Capresso, but not too bad. You might wake up the house with it in the morning, but my child stayed asleep. Once the coffee finishes the grind, the Vienna immediately begins making espresso.My first impression was that I saw a lot more steam coming from the coffee than my Capresso. I am hopeful. The coffee also looked a bit thicker than the Capresso. After the Vienna finished I observed the cup: nice crema, plenty hot, and smells like the genuine article. I gave it a taste--wow, step aside Capresso, this espresso is richer, hotter, and a lot closer to coffee bar espresso. Next I took a sip. Ah yes, the cup holds rich chocolatey espresso. If you are sort of a coffee snob, you'll like what you taste. The coffee is much richer than the Capresso, which I attribute to hotter water and fuller extraction.I'm sure that the Vienna will not make good enough espresso for some folks, but to me, it still tastes better than Starbucks. It was more than $100 cheaper than my Capresso and frankly makes better espresso. I cannot yet speak to the durability of the machine, but the Vienna is now my favorite inexpensive espresso maker.', 'I am hooked.  This is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a chore.  This powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners.  It is just what I have been looking for.  Also try the Blueberry version.  Delicious!', 'These bars are awesome! I first tried them at Starbucks, where they cost $2.45 each, plus tax. Amazons price is $1.48 each, almost one dollar in savings! I eat these for breakfast on the go, or for a quick pick me in the afternoon. The Mango/Macadamia Nut are the only ones i have tried so far, but I absolutly plan on trying the other flavors.', \"It is a mixture of chicken, sweet potato and pasta.

I carried it with me when I flew to Texas and when the water holder was damaged, my daughter in Texas bought me a new Senseo pot.

There has to be 2 or 3 whole mangos per can.  If they would use the natural mango juice instead of light sugary syrup they would have a HIT on their hands.  Still, even with the high sugar content, these canned mangos are terrific as a cake or ice cream topping or even just by themselves.

They are easy to swallow and easy on the digestive system.  My daughter absolutely loved the taste and was constantly reaching out for the spoon between bites!I, too, tried the Baby Gourmet food, and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious taste.  It had the perfect amount of pear to sweeten the vegetable taste without making a child too accustomed to a sugary taste.

I also purchased the coconut (good but not a wowing taste experience like the apricots) and the cherries (chocolate is too sweet for me on those -- probably the same chocolate as on the apricots but with the tarter cherries, the combination of chocolate and fruit just doesn't work as well for me). I will definitely re-buy the apricots. Ok for those to come in the 4-pack. Wish I didn't have to buy a 4-pack of cherries and coconut.

Do not know quality since this was a gift to someone else.', 'This is a review for the Keysands Live Organic Milk Kefir Grains (Tibetan Milk Mushroom), which is what previously linked here and is being discussed by other reviewers...Like one of the other reviewers, I also purchased two brands of kefir grains at relatively the same time from Amazon. In my case, I ordered these from Bulgaricus and also grains from Lifetime Kefir. I am a fan of both grains, though they produce kefir differing in flavor and consistency.The  Bulgaricus grains arrive in relatively large quantities, allowing one to consume the kefir produced after only one \"healing / restoration\" batch.  The grains are relatively thick in diameter--allowing even courses mesh strainers to be used without worry of too many grains passing through. The kefir produced is rather creamy and fairly viscous.Lifetime Kefir arrives in a very small quantity, and it takes about a week to set up.  The grains themselves are extremely tiny, and even after a month or so of cultivation, the individual grains remain small in diameter. The kefir produced by Lifetime Kefir is stronger in taste (acidity) and somewhat less viscous when compared to Bulgaricus.Another reviewer here was complaining about the curds being thick and (perhaps) overly grainy.  The  Bulgaricus kefir curd does separate substantially from the whey.  I like this, as it allows me to remove the milk serum prior to pushing the curds through the strainer, and thereby to effect a thicker, more yoghurt-like kefir.  Leaving the whey in and re-mixing it with the curds, will yield a thinner kefir drink if that is what you are after.  By contrast, I find it harder to get thicker kefir from the Lifetime Kefir grains when I want it, so I appreciate having both varieties around to process in different ways.In the end I find the Bulgaricus kefir to be a fine strain!', \"I'm a big fan of these - delicious and low cal.

It's much better tasting than plain green tea with a hint of peach. I can drink this a couple of times a day easily.

My somewhat painful contractions started around 9:30pm. I was prepared for the long night ahead at home. Well, by 11:30 I had to wake my husband up to go to the hospital. Once we arrived, medical personnel somewhat took their time to admit me. Guess what, when they checked I was 8.5 dilated and ready to push 20 minutes later. 7 pound baby was born at 3:24am after 6 pushes, without any pain meds. According to my husband he flew out like a rocket. And did I mention it was actually on his due date. I have been drinking this tea before getting pregnant, and then starting second trimester one bag daily, sipping for 20 minutes. During last 2 weeks I used 2 bags a day. It must be the tea, since my mom was in labor with her first for over 20 hours, same as I expected for myself. Seven days later I'm drinking it to help my body heal. Don't get me wrong, labor still hurt like nothing I've felt before, but it was fast and a very profound experience.

Yummy!', 'I like \"Vernor's\", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 , no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is \"The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now\" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans.', 'This product was recommended by my vet, and literally saved my cat's life. I was very worried and was willing to try any diet on the market. Really, I have tried many diets etc but nothing seemed to help out my cat after the sudden onset of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).  I have no idea of where that came from. I always gave him clean water; fresh food etc but this caught me off guard. I have been feeding him \"Friskies\" prior to Hill's and everything was fine until one weekend. After a couple of days of feeding him, I noticed an immediate difference. My cat was no longer passing soft stools (diarrhea), and was eating as he normally did. The diet also seems to have been helping him regulate his weight also.

This is one of my favorites now!Amazon's price was better than Stash's own site tooIf you like mint tea you'll like this one.\", 'When I found myself the owner of a dog so smart that I could tell her to unlock the car door and she could do it ( I kid you not, Biscit has the brain of a human 4 year old...) I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my \"baby\" each day.Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)I, personally, have helped friends CURE \"health\" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept \"treating\" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and \"cured\" them!Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.I am a raving fan.and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it.', 'I have looked everywhere for these biscuit/cookies.

We have noticed a huge difference in our pets. Yes, we have cats and dogs all who are rescues. Because of their early history, many have health issues. Since switching them to Newman's Own most have leveled out and we spend less time at the Vet. The food cost less in the long run, because of better health for your animals. We also noticed that all of our animals love this product. Some of them like the dry better than the wet and vis-versa. Some of ours where picky eaters and needed to gain weight. Not anymore, they all show up for dinner eager and ready to eat.My brother-in-law has a 14 year old Siamese who was on Science Diet Food for diabetes.

Sylvia's pepper seems to enhance every food, and the taste just gets better and better.  I really think this is black pepper #1!\", \"When I was younger I spent a few months traveling in India. It was before monsoon season and the weather was really hot and exhausting to us.A friend introduced me to coconut water. For maybe 20 cents you'd get a green coconut with the top lopped off and a straw placed in the center so you could drink the delicious and refreshing coconut water.The people at O.N.E.

Each little package has just the six squares, perfect for snacking for the two of us (pair with peanut butter or nutella for a real delight!).When you think of graham crackers, Honey Maid grahams are the traditional ones that come to mind.

It's a delicious coffee, and though stronger than a lot of coffees, I found it very drinkable and am entirely happy with it.  It's strong, but not at all offensive.  I think it has a pleasant taste, no strong aftertaste, and though I will admit it probably has a bit more kick than, say, my wife's Donut Shop coffee, I'm not buzzed on it.Incidentally, I think the only way to get K-cup coffee is to order it on subscription in order to get the 15 % markdown.  Be aware that even subscription prices are available to rise (and fall, I suppose) with the market.  I had thought the price was locked in, but I was wrong.I love K-cups, and I also love Amazon, but unless the prices drop soon, I'm going to have to buy them at Bed, Bath and Beyond...they're not too expensive over there, and they're always having 20 % off or $5 off coupons, as well as sales, and that is about the only way to get K-cups cheap.

I'm not one for a lot of frills - I had been using Old Spice or Suave, but tried the Dove during the winter because my skin was dry. It works.

This is NOT necessary to get great tasting hummus, though. It was just a personal consistency preference. I didn't have any pita bread in the house, but I did have some toasted pita chips and some thin, soft tortilla bread, and both worked perfectly for pairing with the hummus.

They also hate light so they are very hard to just spot. Most of the times I've seen them have been when I was watching TV in the dark and one fluttered by the front of the TV or I've found them hiding in cracks in my closet.I had a serious moth infestation in my clothes. I sorta ignored it until they ate about 10 of my sweaters. They were literally in shreds. When I threw all the wool clothes away they started eating the cotton stuff as well (although not as successfully) so I decided to get these traps because I didn't want to use poisons or whatever. They did a good job of trapping a lot of moths but like the packaging says, these basically will ALERT you that you have a problem they aren't going to totally solve it.Eventually I threw away a lot of old clothes and then washed everything else all at once and put anything wool into plastic bags. The moths WILL attempt to eat your cotton stuff but they don't tend to be as destructive to it (you'll see the cocoons on the clothes but they won't be all full of holes like the wool stuff) Vacumming in your closets will also help get rid of them. I then put cedar chips in my closet. Not quite sure how useful that is but I have definitely slowed them down and haven't seen any more destruction since.I uploaded a photo of one of my traps that caught about 20 moths to prove these do work. Just realize to get rid of your problem you're going to have to do more than just get these traps.\", \"The CHEEZ-IT Mozzarella Cheese snack is totally yummy. My entire family loved these.

Great taste, moist, good texture - no big holes, etc. I mixed this with a small hand mixer, because I don't have a stand mixer which the recipe actually says to use. I still end up with a very nice bread. It is stickier than a flour based bread that you would knead. Because of that I find it hard to get a really smooth top - no kneading, no rolling, to shape. I even took my Mother a slice. She is a white bread person. She toasted the slice and really liked it. It does taste a bit like a whole grain bread, bit of a sweet tasted.

I can't sing the praises of this food loud enough.  My cat is no longer straining to urinate, or going outside the box.  I have yet to find a variety either of my kitties don't like.

One of my dogs has terrible allergies and if I feed her \"normal\" food, she gets terrible dandruff. However, when I bring her out, everyone mentions how soft and shiny her coat is. My vet remarks that her teeth are in amazing shape (no plaque). She has never had bad breath one day in her life nor has she ever been overweight! I attribute this to her diet. She is 49 lbs and she gets two cups per day of Acana, any type, though Grasslands, Pacifica and this have been the best (the others I admit are too expensive for me, and I don't feed chicken). I don't feed wet food, but she does get one or two treats per day as well. My other dog is 30 lbs and she gets 1.5 cups per day as she is a little porker and will find scraps around the house wherever she can. This dog does have bad breath, which we are realize is likely due to digestion. We have switched from Pacifica (which is very high in Omega oils) to this one and her breath has vastly improved. My vet said that terrier breeds usually have poorer digestion, and high fats can cause some bad breath. I am buying Lamb & Okanagan Apple from now on. I trust this company and appreciate the efforts they put into their product. I have also e-mailed the company to ask about digestibility and they took the time to e-mail me back with thoughtful insight.

I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.

I have many varieties, and I love them. But this tea is especially lovely. From the long, thin white tea leaves to the jasmine blossom petals, what a treat for the eyes, nose, and palate. The fragrance hits you as soon as you open the container and lasts throughout the cup. I followed the directions and steeped the tea as suggested. The first cup was heavenly, the second brew delicious, but the third was a bit weak. It was never bitter, never harsh, and never \"too green.\"Yes, it's expensive, but it is organic, hand-picked, authentic, whole white tea leaves and whole jasmine petals. A little goes a long way.

It also seems to clog up faster than I have experienced before.  I tend to have to remove the cap and clean it out at the sink in order to unclog it and remove the excess chili oil from dripping down the side of the bottle.

It's made as a \"light viennese style\" shortbread which is why it's soooo soft compared to their usual shortbread cookies.  Also, there's a distinctive vanilla taste to it.  There are 12 shortbreads in the 5.3 oz box.', \"These steel cut oats are wonderful. I usually soak them overnight to cut down on cooking the next morning. Sometimes I'll add blueberries, raspberries or a cut up apple. The texture and the taste can't be beat. Perfect for a cold winter morning.

It's a great value for the price.\", \"I can't speak for the kids, but as an adult, these rice bars make a perfect snack.  The peanuts provide protein while the rice and chocolate provide carbs.  These bars would be great for anyone with a busy lifestyle.  They're not messy, which makes them an ideal snack while working on the computer.  They're surprisingly tasty and flavorful.  The consistency is very appealing - soft yet crispy.  I buy these a lot.\", \"I needed to find a grind and roast that would fit my need for the taste I was used to with my home espresso machine, a high end Illy that broke and left me after 10 years of service! I went low tech and bought a Bialetti stainless steel 4 cup model with a valve system that creates foam and great crema. The Lavazza crema e gusto ground coffee works perfectly in this pot, only takes a few minutes to brew and the taste is wonderful, full bodied, rich and with no bitterness. For me, it lingers with a bit of smokiness and overtone of dark chocolate. Sometimes I place a very thin 99% cocoa square on the back of my tongue if I'm drinking this coffee later in the day and have a craving for something. It can distract me from many other more caloric choices!\", 'I absolutely love my Keurig. But every now and then I found myself getting bored with the selection of K-Cups. I resorted to buying a reusable K-Cup and filling it with freshly ground beans from Starbucks. The results were less than desirable. I would never get the mesaurements right and I would end up having to make a trip to get coffee.These K-Cups from starbucks are a godsend! the price is not bad. The ratio of coffee grounds to water is the same every time so my coffee comes out great. I am a happy person once again! I also love the house blend because even though it says its a lighter blend, its starbucks. Its roasted darker than most. So if you are a strong coffee lover i think the house blend will suit you just fine.', 'these olives are the smoothest olives I have had.

I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food. Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis. A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing. I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results. I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food. I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity. I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it. This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:* Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.* Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.* Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.* Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.* Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.* High DigestibilityNo Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco or head to the Natural Balance website. Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals. You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat. I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic. I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days!Note:  This is essentially the same review I wrote about Natural Balance a couple of years ago, but my cat still loves it and I'm still buying it ... on Amazon.\", 'Spam brings back happy memories of a simpler childhood, and happiness was easier to attain.

We love Asian food, (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.) and have used them in restaurants as well as in our own cooking. As far as taste? Excellent!

It is true it is quite salty but what good beef jerky isn't???? My husband a fitness/gym nut LOVES this jerky as well as the high protein content! I also LOVE the extremly low fat content as I cannot stand chewing on leather or fat that never chews away! This product is not only healthy (aside from salt), filling, great tasting, and a great snack thats easy to eat it is also CHEAP! At least in my perspective!

This is an attachment that one must order, it is not the attachment that comes standard with the machine. I had the double pod on hand. I normally use two Senseo pods per small mug of coffee on a daily basis anyway.With the Baronet, I ordered a strong, dark coffee and run both the 2-cup cycle and the one-cup cycle to get a full mug of coffee that suits my taste buds just fine.Very satisfied.', \"I really like this sea salt -- has a different flavor, and it's very colorful to use on veggies.\", 'All I can say is there is nothing more delicious than Carnation Malted Milk.

It is sooooo easy to use.  I was a little overwhelmed at first with the thought of making my own baby food, when one of my friends suggested this item.  The baby cook takes the hassle out of using multiple pots/devices to make the babyfood. I was buying organic jarred babyfood, now will be making my own.  Ends up being cheaper and tastes way better.

I love these little, ready-made bottles because they are the perfect size and there is no mixing needed - just shake, open, screw on a nipple, and feed the baby.These don't come with nipples, but you can use regular bottle nipples or get disposable nipples separately. You can buy about 50 disposable Similac nipples from the Abbott store online or use Enfamil disposable nipples (I've used these - they fit fine), which they sell on Amazon.com in packs of 10 or 25.I have two nipples in a ziplock bag and 4 bottles in my diaper bag at all times.

While still high, the sodium for the can is 920 mg: much less then in a \"regular\" soup.  The satisfying taste belies the 140 calories and only 2 g of fat! The liquid is light, but there is lots to chew on in the bowl: many chunks of meat and firm veggies make this a meal, rather then a snack. The ring on top of the can makes it easy to open. You can tuck a can in your purse and take it along to the office for a quick lunch. So far, so good.The only downside is the price. Even though I ordered the soup thru the Subscribe and Save programme, I paid for the dozen more then $6 over the price in the local mass retailer.

I am sure about the schnauzer poodle and not totally sure about the jack russell/chihuahua as they are rescues. But they are about around 18 months old and 10-12 pounds; they both enjoyed the first rounds of treats TREMENDOUSLY. I mean, sat down and chewed on them for HOURS. Which is amazing because they are both such active dogs. Also, they did not have gas or digestion problems after eating, which was great.My friend gave the treats to her yorkie and bulldog and they loved them too. She said that it was the first time that her bulldog has growled, ever and he is three years old. They also did not have gas or digestion problems.Now, the real test - the other three treats for my dogs. Would they eat them or lose interest? They chewed them and loved them just as much as the first time. Okay, maybe not quite as much, because they lasted longer the second time, but still had the same great results.I would not give these  treats to my dogs on a regular basis, just because I don't believe in lots of treats.

Amazon's price as of this writing is 32.49.Amazon.com shopping tip: if there is only one price shown for the product, as opposed to a 'list price' with a line crossed through it and a cheaper, generic 'price' underneath, then there are likely better options available elsewhere.\", '....even though this was in the fridge for me, my husband grabbed it before I could get to it!  This is typical of him, eating and drinking things I intended to consume; but here is what he had to say about it:  fruity, smooth, no weird after taste like many energy drinks contain.  Did not notice any caffeine buzz or \"energy\" but very good as a beverage.  Would he drink another? Sure, but probably would go for something else with less calories, less sugar, and more of a kick.I have to note that before I placed this in the fridge to chill, I noticed that the entire can contains no more caffeine than a large strong coffee.  The sugar content is high, and for those who want to spare themselves extra calories will not be impressed with that here, but my guess is the that this appeals to a crowd who doesn't (yet) have to worry about caloric intake.', 'Well, according to our 12 week old Miniature Dachshund anyway!

Now, some of the other flavors do and I think some of them are gross but this flavor is like eating a dang Chunky candy bar or something. Seriously, they are so good. They are really crumbly though so don't eat them in your jammies watching TV late at night (guilty!) or you will wake up covered in chocolate. :) But if you like nutty chocolate bars you will love these and you won't feel as guilty as if you were eating chocolate candy...but you won't be able to tell that you aren't!', \"We moved our two Bengals from canned Fancy Feast chicken and turkey to Wellness Chicken.  It resolved a diarrhea problem quickly-- we think one of the cats became allergic to something in that Fancy Feast.  They enjoy Wellness much more; they have never attacked any food or treat more voraciously, even real chicken.  Plus, the litter box does not smell as bad, and I feel better about giving them food without nasty byproducts.  This is described as human-quality food, though I haven't been brave enough to try, I believe it.  Instead of smelling like a bag of fast food that got stuck under the seat in my car for a month, this smells like chicken soup.We tried getting our boys onto Avoderm, which definitely made their coats shinier and softer, and even increased their activity level (hard to believe for these Bengals).  However, once the mix got to be over 50% Avoderm, they didn't like the taste.  Can't give a low rating to any cat food because of taste.One note about shipping-- the packaging has not been perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers say.  The second case I received had a few cans with minor dents, but nothing was leaking.  The shipping box is larger than the case, with air-filled plastic pillows to fill the voids.This is not the least expensive food out there, but you are getting a better product.

So, I ordered one online (a little different from this one).The cats loved it.I wasn't sure how much they'd love it or tolerate it, so I filled their treat ball with this.The food is a nice size for cats, and it is just smelly enough for them to be interested andhumans to not mind it.I do wish Blue Buffalo would be a little more clear on what the difference is between the varioustypes of dry cat food. We bought the Spa Select the first time, and I got this one this time.I don't know what the difference is, and I didn't save the bag.  More clarification or a comparisonchart from the vendor would be nice.  Even their own site does not really do a good job of this.They compare against other cat food brands, but not within themselves.Anyway, the cats both love it, and the ingredients are very healthy for them.  Little if any fillers.We fill their treat ball with this food, and feed them wet once a day.This is the food they go after at 3 in the morning.\", 'Love the pineapple flavor.

I love lentils for vegetarian meals, though I've made a few spectacular non-vegetarian meals with them as well, including one with diced carrot and celery, turkey bacon, and thyme, sauteed together, then combined with the lentils and a little chicken or veg stock.  I also dump a can into a quick soup, usually with canned tomatoes and some kind of green, like kale.  They are possibly good enough to be eaten straight from the can, but I have yet to be in that much of a hurry.  They're an amazing convenience, and really healthy, so that makes me happy.  I love lentils spicy, savory, in soups and stews, in salads, as side dishes, I've even made a sauce with lentils.  I used to occasionally buy these vacuum-sealed refrigerated lentils from Trader Joe's and they were great, but a little dry and also perishable.

It comes highly recommended. We made ribs using this sauce and were very impressed.

A couple of days before I had run out of regular ground coffee and had a panic attack.  I decided that I would keep a jar of instant around to keep me off a respirator next time.  I decided after returning home to try a cup of this brew.  I have to confess that its not only been a very long time since I have had instant coffee in the house, but its also been a while since I tasted instant anywhere.  Even though I am sure the quality of instant has changed quite a bit since the days of old, I still know a fresh rich aroma when I smell it, and this coffee has as much a delightful bouquet as most  ground coffee I have smelled.  Its richness of flavor is evident by just cracking the jar open.  I used a little more than a level teaspoon for my first cup and found the brew a little weak.  My second cup was with a heaping teaspoon and the improvement was distinct. (On really heavy mornings, try two, it won't kill ya..: ) I found it nothing less than downright delicious.  Although a lot of folks feel compelled to always say that no instant can compare to fresh brewed, I am going to go out on a limb and say that this Nescafe tastes as good to me as most cups of regular blend, moderately priced coffee available.  (Hills Brothers, Maxwell House, Folders, etc).  It can't compete with a gourmet blend for sure, but against the well known familiar competition, it will give it a darn good run. And of course it is a whole lot faster and convenient. This Nescafe is rather easy to find in most grocery stores.  But if you have trouble locating it, by all means get it here on Amazon by the case.  Its very reasonably priced just about anywhere, and just about the best and most delicious you will locate in an instant around this price range.  Highly recommended....\", 'Great crispy gluten free cereal! I like this a lot better than Erewhon rice cereal. Erewhon is overly sweetened, and not as crispy.

I use it primarily when making vinegarette salad dressing, but it is also wonderful for white sauce-based dishes, and any vegetable in place of salt.', 'I used this for the first time, the other day, to make banana bread.  I had a favorite recipe and just substituted this Bob's GF flour.  The recipe called for 2 cups of flour, so I used 1 3/4 cups of this product and 1/4 cup of Hazelnut flour(ground hazelnut).  As I was mixing it, I did notice it smelled a little odd--a smell I didn't care for.  From reading some other reviews, I'm guessing it's the bean flour.  But I stuck to the recipe, adding sour cream, cinnamon, natural vanilla extract, etc.  Baked it.  When it was cool, I was a little nervous, but when I tasted it, I thought it tasted great.  My mom thought it was delicious and wanted to take some home, even my fast-food loving husband said it was really good and \"doesn't taste gluten free.\"  Not that he's really had any gluten free baked goods.The texture was good.  It didn't rise as much as regular flour, so no spilling in the oven.  Baking time took longer than my original recipe.  Small muffins took about 30 minutes and the glass loaf pan took over an hour.  But on both the texture was good, moist(though a bit more crumbly) and no odd taste or smell in the finished product(despite the smell noticed when I was mixing the batter).  I think I prefer the muffins because they were done sooner and, thus, less brown on top.  Then I just pop them into the toaster oven the next day and they're like fresh baked.I really liked the result for sweets with this product!', \"I add international delight vanilla creamer to this coffee and it is so delicious!

However, I have to say that nowhere on the box, or the individual packets, are instructions for actually making the coffee.  Also it doesn't tell you what type of coffee maker to use or even how much water to use for each packet.  I use K-cups and my daughter uses T-cups.  I had to make this product in my old automatic drip coffee maker, and I had to guess on how much water to use.

I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.

It's what our vet recommended when out Boston Terrier was a puppy and he's been eating it ever since. We change up the flavor that we buy occasionally, but he really seems to like the chicken.

Since I live less than 8 miles from Costco, I will go to Costco to purchase.', 'We got some samples from a local pet food store after the spoiled chi's had just about trained us that table food was all that they would eat. They all like this duck/sweet potato dry (with some table scrap meat).A couple of days ago we found canned Fromm (various varieties) & started to mix this with the dry. Surprise, surprise--after a few minutes of looking at me with the \"where is the good stuff\" look, they ate it. We change the flavor of the canned (after a can is used up) and mix it with the duck/potato dry and thats all they get now--(well  except for some treats every now & then).', \"Growing up in Milwaukee, Gardetto's breadsticks and snack mix were always a favorite.  When I moved to Florida they were not readily available in stores (though I see them everywhere now).  I love that I can buy the snack mix products in small snack size bags.  A perfect size to take along on a car or plane trip or just for a snack in front of the TV (I fear what I might do with the big bag).  The seasoning is amazingly flavorful - Pretzels, Breadsticks and Rye Chips! What more could you want?

Highly recommend.', 'I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.', \"These people from Bavaria really know how to make this stuff. The Landjagers are super (you have to let them dry for them to develop their full, intended flavor), and it is worth any sausage fan's time to check out their complete offering of German style sausages and hams.  Due to the perishability of some of their products their S&H charges appear outrageous but I guess that sending frozen or refrigerated foods costs money.

The chocolate is ok, but I am not a fan of dark chocolate, which this reminds me of. I would be willing to say that the regular is about as close to peter pan peanut butter as I have tasted and that is probably my favorite peanut butter. I will also say this, If someone made you a PB&J sandwich with this, you would be very hard pressed to tell that this was a low fat, low calorie peanut butter. I use the regular and Walden Farms zero calorie, zero carb grabe jelly for a very nice, guilt free PB&J sandwich.

Great taste, and lots of it!', 'For my dog:I have been using this oil for a couple weeks now on & off.  I have just started giving it to my dog (who has been limping & having trouble rising from a sitting & laying position)for about a week now.  HE LOVES IT!  He can't wait to get his dog treat in the morning with it smeared on one side and in the afternoon it is the first thing he eats out of his food (I put about a tablespoon sized dollop on top of his dry dog food).  I have definitely noticed an improvement in his mobility & his coat seems to be much softer.  I had also done some research & found out that it will eliminate stinky dog breath!  I can't wait for that to happen. It is safe for cats too... If you want to know more about giving it to your pets, just do a Google search using the words \"coconut oil for my pets\" and plenty of info will be at your fingertips! :)For my kids:I have done extensive research on Coconut oil & the benefits it has on our bodies. I can tell you that the antiviral benefit it has definitely works. My son (recently turned 12)just recently had a virus that included coughing, a sore throat and had caused him to break out in a rash that only spread onto one side of his body... Doctor said it had to run it's course.  I started giving him some of this oil on toast with the normal butter & cinnamon sugar & within a couple days he started getting better. We stopped giving him the oil & he got sick again... So we started the oil again, but this time HE was putting it on things, himself, to eat--he realized that it was making him better the first time. I think that maybe we didn't give it enough time to work the first time.  For my daughter: After a couple of days of sleeping a ton, being very sick & calling me at work crying because she couldn't stay awake, I took my daughter (13 y.o. then, 17 y.o. now) to the doctor & she was diagnosed with Mono. The doctor explained to me that it is part of the Epstein Barr family (cold sores, herpes, etc.) and that there isn't any kind of medicine that can \"cure\" the illness. He explained that she would sleep a lot, that I needed to call her school & tell them what she had & that she would only be there half days for a few months. I was deflated, stressed & couldn't believe there was nothing I could do for her. I had recently read a book that included coconut oil as a way to detox, lose weight, boost metabolism and so many others and had bought some oil to cook with & take daily. I had done a search & read as much as I could about the coconut & remembered reading that it killed the Epstein Barr virus. I went straight to my computer when I got home & did another search & found the article I had read. I decided to give my daughter the oil twice a day to see if it helped her. I called her down & melted the oil in a spoon & had her take it that afternoon & then again later that evening. The next morning before I left for work I gave her another dose. She called me around lunch time very happy and excited and said she wasn't tired and could stay awake. I remember thinking that the oil was working and was very relieved, but still a bit hesitant. When I got home to my surprise, she was very excited, wide awake & for the first time since she was sick, was chipper and I could tell she was getting back to her old self. I gave her another dose of the oil that evening & for a few days after and she was all better. The oil had killed the virus and restored her health.This stuff is amazing... it cooks food well & is fabulous for your skin.  If you burn in the sun, this will help prevent that as well.  If you are a coconut user this stuff is great... If you're not, this is worth a try.', 'Just like the Nabisco Lemon Coolers before they discontinued them.

I couldn't have been more wrong! I bit into it and got a crunch from the almonds on top and (I had to check the ingredients) soy crisps inside! I received one bar as a sample and went out and bought an entire box that same week! However, even though on the package it says that it tastes great heated up, I didn't like it. Heated up it lost the crunch and seemed to become that dreaded chewy bar. I still give this product 5 stars though because heating it up is definitely not something that you have to do!\", \"This is THE best salad dressing.  I've had Catalina, as well as Sweet Honey Catalina and liked them both very much.  However I am obsessed with Tangy Tomato Bacon....the new Catalina.  I've been a fan for over 7 years.  When I moved to Manhattan I had to have friends and family ship this salad dressing to me, since it is the only way I will eat a salad. Not sure why Kraft decided to change the name of Tangy Tomato Bacon & get rid of the old Catalina.......and honestly don't care since they made the right decision in keeping this flavor!

The coconut oil is in a solid state, which it should be.  Once it hits the kettle it melts.  You heat your oil, and then add the popcorn and salt.  I do recommend putting the popcorn and salt together in a scoop or something for ease of emptying into the kettle (if you have a popcorn machine), otherwise it gets messy.I read several reviews that using all the salt makes the popcorn too salty.  We didn't find that at all.There were several unpopped kernels, so I'm not sure if this is the popcorn or not being used to our machine yet.This is perfect for our 4 oz popcorn machine and leaves the whole house smelling like a movie theatre.

I just wanted to add that the coffee you brew up can be very easily stored.  Just let it cool a bit and then place the carafe in the fridge.

More likely, you'll go to your local market and buy one box.2) If you have had it and you're looking at this item, you're trying to decide if you want to buy a 4-pack.I have a 4-pack delivered every month via \"Subscribe & Save\" and here's why:My local groceries carry the smaller 12oz boxes for about $3-$3.50, the 16.7 oz box is usually about $5-$5.50.  Bear in mind, this item is a 4-pack of 16.7 oz boxes.The subscribe & save option from Amazon takes 15% off (did I also mention no shipping, no commitment) which lowers the $20 price tag to more like $17 for four boxes, or $4.25 per box- that's almost a dollar off what my grocery charges!So, I get the cereal I love, delivered to my door regularly and automatically, for almost a dollar less than what I'd have to pay if I drove to the store.

Starbucks Via instant coffee tastes as close as you can get to regular brewed coffee. I was shocked at how good it is. It's rich, bold, and flavorful.

And from recent accounts, Pepsi is going to leave it on the shelves even longer now (see article in Comments section below.) So check locally first. My Super Target carries exactly this 12-pack for three to four dollars. Compare with the thirty-five bucks (including exorbitant shipping) some Amazon merchants are trying to get!On to the review. I will keep it short, because the important thing is that old fashioned Mountain Dew (labeled \"Throwback\" just like \"Heritage\" for Dr. Pepper) tastes much better with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Less harsh and more enjoyable. If you drank Mountain Dew prior to the sugar switch back in the mid 1980s, you will almost surely prefer this. For younger drinkers only accustomed to fake sugar, who knows? Their taste buds may have been irreparably harmed. LOLIt doesn't come in moonshine jugs, but at least you get Willy the Hillbilly on the cans. One recent tweak is that orange juice concentrate is back in the formula. I didn't catch the initial 2009 Throwback release but evidently it was missing the OJ.

The individual package has a plastic ring at the top for sturdiness, covered with foil (as is any K-cup; but from there it is completly different.  There is no plastic cup, only a very fine filter material holding the coffee in a space that is half of what a k-cup would use.  I have seen some reviews that assume this means there is only half of the coffee of a k-cup; but it brews a rich full cup.The first thing that I did was try to find my refillable k-cup to hold it.  Doesn't fit.  Next, I tried placing it into the metal filter for the refillable k-cup.  Doesn't fit.  So I threw caution to the wind, placed the little packet into the b-75 as if it were a real k-cup.......guess what.....it is.  It worked great, will probably keep the lower piercing needle from plugging and made a very nice cup of coffee witout all of the high tech k-cup innards.  Since the is a green mountain compny. i guess they are trying new configuraions.  This one works; but it will require smaller stocking orders much more often to maintain freshness.........a major plus for the original k-cup.I am a strong advocate of sustainable agriculture and fair trade for the farmers.......+++ with this line\", \"Por Kwan is the ONLY brand of chilli paste with holy basil leaves worth buying.  I get it at my local Asian markets for $1.59, but if I couldn't get it anywhere else, I would ABSOLUTELY pay the $3.75 price listed here. Other brands are not nearly as flavorful.  Por Kwan is concentrated flavor... POW!  Not just heat... the perfect melding of garlic, basil and chili... there's a depth to it that I can't describe.  Just try it!\", 'Excellent product.  All our dogs love to take their pills inside these pliable, tasty little \"wrappers\" and don't even notice they are getting medicine. Easy to handle, easy to wrap around any size/shape pills.  These are a great find. We keep them in the fridge so they are easier to handle, not \"melty.\" Worth every penny.', \"Wonderful flavor.

So many micro-nutrients, and now that the honey supply is in question with honey bee shortage (see Dr. Mercola's recent article that 75% of our honey is actually a product coming from China, including that in big box stores)maple syrup is even more immportant to us as I am not comfortable buying honey.\", 'One of the best candies ever!

Forget cocaine...  Forget meth...  NOTHING is more addictive than these \"chips\".  Heed these words: these \"chips\" will cause the downfall all modern civilization.In all seriousness, these things are very tasty, and nowhere near as bad for you as an old fashion potato chip.My wife picked up a small bag in an airport vending machine while on a trip.  She saved a few \"chips\" for me to try when she got home.  I was so impressed with the taste, and the nutrition label, that I immediately thought of my dad.  He loves a good snack item (don't we all?), but with a recent diabetes diagnosis, and the ever increasing challenge to lose a few pounds, his \"snacking\" options have been getting pretty sparse.So I shoot him a text message, and include a picture of the nutrition label from the back of the bag.

It is a great way to try out different flavors without having to buy a box of one flavor not knowing if you will like it.', 'Great full-bodied, organic coffee with medium acidity. The addition of yerba mate to the arabica beans gives this coffee a nice, mildly sweet, finishing note. The cost is reasonable for the coffee. I drink many types of organic, gourmet coffee. This rates as one of my top three all time favorites.', 'For many years my cold cereal of choice has been Grape Nuts.  It has a decent flavor, unbeatable crunch, no added sugar, no \"chemistry\" ingredients, and an excellent nutrition profile.  (My hot cereal of choice has been old-fashioned oats w/ Raisins and Brown Sugar.)Well, after a trip to Europe I am now a convert, and this has displaced those faithful Grape Nuts for a permanent place in my pantry.  This remarkable cereal is made of simple ingredients; rolled whole grains (wheat, barley, and oats), dried fruits, seeds, nuts.  (Think granola without the sugar or the baking)  No added sugar, binders, starches, preservatives, oil, flavor enhancers, salt, etc.  For those concerned about processed food intake, take comfort that the only processing this has undergone is that the grains are steamed (which is done during the rolling process; this makes the grains edible), and then the drying of the fruit.  While it doesn't qualify as a \"raw\" food (grains are largely indigestible completely raw) it's much less processed than just about any other cold cereal out there except Granola.While it obviously has no crunch, it has a pleasant chewiness instead after soaking in milk while you take your shower or wait for your coffee to brew.  I usually chop up a banana or toss in some berries if I have them on-hand.  (I tired soaking overnight, and thought it got too mushy)  It has more flavor than the Grape Nuts, and two \"servings\" (2 x a puny 1/4 cup) of this make for a similar nutrition profile.  (The fruit displaces some of the starch for sugar, and the seeds add a trivial amount of fat.)I considered giving some genuine European Muesli a try, but the ones I looked at (Familia) have either sugar and/or a large amount of dried fruit, which, after having this stuff, is totally not necessary.  (Of course, as a Grape Nuts replacement, just about any cereal with sugar in it tastes sweet.)  The amount of dried fruit in this cereal is enough to give it a little flavor, without overwhelming you with cloying sweetness.Don't be fooled by the Kellogs \"Mueslix.\"  They started with traditional Muesli, and then they added unsweetened flakes (corn?) to it.  This introduces soggy nastiness for no particular reason.  I guess they thought suggesting the cereal soak for a few minutes (and leaving out the flakes) would be too complicated.The only \"drawback\" of this cereal is that it feels expensive for the little bag.  However, you can get eight hearty servings out of it, and you'd have to resort to some fairly pricey major-brand products to get something this tasty, unprocessed, and healthy.', 'I know there are arguments for and against but I feel dry food is a \"space age\" relic that was good for pet food companies, but not necessarily for pets.  Cats in particular require foods with a high moisture content that dry food lacks.  That doesn't leave canned pet food marketers in the clear either as your definition of acceptable ingredients probably does not include many of the ingredients the FDA and AAFCO considers safe.  (Google the list, it'll be worth it.)My cat normally gets a variety of Wellness and Blue Buffalo Wilderness canned foods.  These are generally considered premium foods but I'm always on the lookout for other ways to add variety to her diet.  What I like most about this food is they clearly state the food contains 95% meat.  That is a huge plus that no other pet food I am aware of matches.  I realize other pet foods will list a meat as the first ingredient, but if the second, third, and fourth ingredients are starches, grains, or vegetables you could end up with food that is less than 50% meat even if it's the first ingredient on the list.  Humans are omnivores, dogs are to some extent, but cats must have meat and bones to survive.So many advertised cat food brands contain mostly unhealthy high-carbohydrate ingredients like corn, wheat and so on as primary ingredients that it makes me mad.  You don't see your housecat in the garden pouncing on a wild ear of corn or a potato, do you?  These items should have never made their way into cat foods in the first place.  That is why I am very happy to see a pet food that actually lists a high percentage of meat content on the label.  As you can expect, it tends to be more expensive, almost twice as much as cheap brands.  Consider this, however.  When I opened my eyes to what I was really feeding my pet and switched, my cat ate half as much as the brand-name junk.  It seems once you start feeding your pet real digestible food, they don't need to eat as much of it.Of course the real critic of this food is my cat.  I am happy to report that not only does she like this food but my normally quiet and reserved cat will meow her desire if she catches a whiff of what's inside the can.  Since she rarely meows for anything, that's quite a compliment.  I will be purchasing more of this in the future.', 'We rescued a Cairn Terrier (Toto, Wizard of Oz, was a Cairn.) We found out he had tested positive, and even with the cost of heart worm treatment, you could look in those dark eyes, and know 'someone is in there. The dog has a personality.

I enjoy a strong chai and all of these spices, so I typically leave the tea bag in my tea, not ever removing it. Numi tea does not get bitter when you do this. It might take me a half hour to drink the tea, but it still tastes wonderful and very strong, so this works for me.All of Numi's teas are the absolute best quality, using premium organic teas and herbs and real fruits, flowers, and spices (as opposed to \"natural\" flavors or fragrances). They are also gluten-free. Numi uses natural biodegradable filter-paper tea bags, not GMO corn or plastic silky bags. Their boxes are recyclable and are printed with soy-based inks. From beginning to end, this is a tea that exceeds all of my expectations.Highly recommended.*****', \"Hempseed flavor reminds me of pine nuts.  Hempseed contain all nine essential amino acids, which makes them a complete protein, like egg whites and soy. One ounce of hemp provides 45 percent of daily magnesium requirement. Studies show that a diet rich in magnesium can slash diabetes risk by almost half, because it increases insulin sensitivity.My favorite way to eat hempseed is as a dip or a spread on a sandwich.  I use the same recipe for both.  I puree 1 Tbsp. ground hemp seeds, 2 Tbsp. store-bought pesto, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 1 can cannellini beans.Hempseed are easy to spill from the plastic bag they arrive in, so when I am ready to use a new bag I pour the bag into a plastic container designed for cereal, this allows me to pour the seeds out of the container's spout without spilling the seeds on the counter.

The other cheeses in the selection are outstanding and I have received rave reviews from everyone I have served them to. Only negative is that they came extremely hot (even though they were in a cooler-type box with an ice pack that I assume had at one time been cold) and the softer cheeses were really melted. They still tasted great, but weren't as nice for presentation.\", 'Layla is extremely picky and has left certain luxury brand wet foods out to waste simply because they were unappetizing to her (How? I don't know!). And yes, she is probably too spoiled =), but I recently adopted her malnourished and hyperthyroid and I have been trying my best to get her on a healthy eating schedule. Anyway, the only flavor she goes absolutely nuts over is the Polynesian BBQ! She will go on hunger strikes if I don't have that flavor around. I don't know what they put in this flavor (crack? =)) to make Layla go nuts, but it's all she wants and now I'm forced to keep buying it.If you have a cat that has problems eating or is malnourished/anorexic (like Layla was), you would be hard-pressed to find food as high quality and apparently tasty as Weruva. My body-builder boyfriend remarked that perhaps if he gets hungry late one night he might pop open a can! It is made from free-range animals, and is processed in a human-grade facility. My only gripe, and it is VERY small, is that most of the food looks the same in the can (particularly the chicken flavors), so it feels like I'm not feeding Layla a variety or something special sometimes. And maybe cats prefer it like that--I do know they can be creatures of habit, so who knows?Again, if you have a picky or skinny cat, I would not hesitate to pick up a few cans of either polynesian bbq, steak frites, or grandmother's chicken soup. They are similar in price to other \"luxury\" brands, but the quality of Weruva is far superior. You aren't losing anything, and you may end up with a very happy cat =).EDIT: Layla had to stop taking her methimazole due to side effects, and while we were working with her vet for other options, her stooling and over-urination (polyuria) have normalized. ! I am certainly not attributing this solely to the food, but I think the high quality nutrition and supplements she has been receiving have helped Layla heal and perhaps  helped to correct some of her metabolic abnormalities. AND on a side note,  when I received Layla, her hair was like matted wire that fell out with just petting; now it is getting silky, and without those pesky oily parts (you know, behind the front legs?).

It is made in Texas -not China - has pretty wholesome ingredients and from my experience is not unreasonably expensive and the dog loves them. They are crisp and snap easily into smaller pieces if necessary. Now about that product description... it says \"Pack of 5\" and shows 5 Merrick Chicken Steak Patties just like they would look unwrapped from the pack. The problem is that at $60.99 this comes to about $12.00 per patty which IS unreasonably expensive. Ok, so maybe what they mean is that there are 5 of these 5 packs which would be about $2.40 per patty. This is still more than twice as much as they charge for them retail at the local pet food store. In the product description it says the product weighs 1 lb. Well, one 5 pack weighs 2.5 oz. so 5 would only weigh 12.5 oz. The shipping weight is listed as 4.5 lbs!!! I just don't understand how this can possibly be correct.

While it's brewing I get the distinct aroma of cinnamon rolls. I brew in a Keurig B40 and choose the 9.25oz serving size and think the brew strength is exactly right. My usual method of serving is to heat about 6 ounces of skim milk in the microwave for 1 minute, add about 1 tablespoon SF Torani Vanilla Syrup and froth using my Aerolatte thingie. Then I add the coffee to the milk and stir gentle. It's as good as anything I can get at Starbucks!', 'With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: \"Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag\"Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: \"At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are \"trans fat free\" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.\"  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.', 'When I received this \"Lickety Stik\", I really wasn't sure what to expect with my dog.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about - he is CRAZY about it.  If I even go near the bottle he starts wagging his tail and giving me the excited look.  One aspect about this doohickey I really like is that you can use it as a reward for your pet, without constantly having to give him a biscuit or similar treat; just a lick off the Lickety Stik will do the trick!  The occasional biscuit and treat is okay, but this is much better for active training.  Highly recommend, though you may want to shy away from trying it yourself.', 'This is not an extraordinarily hot hot sauce, despite the product description emphasizing the habanero peppers within and it being \"Extra Hot\". It IS a extraordinarily tasty sauce, and aromatic to boot.Yum! Accept no substitutes.Well, do it if you have to, but then go get some Melinda's.', \"My husband can't drink coffee or decaf so he drinks this every morning.  It is very convenient for me to buy it via Amazon as I can buy a large quantity in one shot.  I think the price is about the same as grocery stores, but most stores in our area don't carry it so this is the way to go for me.  Saves me time from running from place to place looking for it.\", \"This is a great product.  I can use it in the shower and not have to switch to any other product.

The flavor that explodes in your mouth right away is of a juicy pear; I kid you not. Buying a pound of them finally gave me a chance to keep them around for awhile, because I've always had a hard time not eating them all. I love the licorice beans too, and I really love all the fruit flavors: green apple, peach, cherry, lime, grapefruit, lime, grapefruit, lemon and tangerine, but nothing wows my taste buds like the \"juicy pear\". I would order more if the shipping cost weren't so high.', \"I get this product every 6 months, without fail.  Seems my Wal-Mart doesn't carry it anymore.  Don't ever get hooked on anything and expect Wal-Mart to keep carrying it.  Anyway, drink this wonderful tasting and keeps me full through the afternoon between meals.

I buy it in bulk and leave it my car.\", 'I ordered these mangoes and it came earlier than expected. After I opened the package I started eating it right away and it was amazing. It is not too sugary because it does not have any added sugars, just the natural fruit sugar and was just the right amount of sweet.

I have a great deal of very long, very fine, very straight hair, and generally I find that conditioners leave my hair feeling not conditioned enough (and sadly dry and static-y, particularly since I moved to the desert) or far too weighed down by product. This conditioner did neither -- it just left my hair feeling thick and shiny and smooth. I haven't been using it long enough to see if it really reduces split ends -- I brush carefully, so I'm not particularly prone to them anyway -- but it's worth the price even if that particular claim is bunk, because my hair has never in my life felt this healthy before.\", 'You get a lot of flavor for 100 calories with these Pop Chips.

I carried a piece of paper with the name for many years but could never find in Calif. or on the internet. Imagine my surprise when I ran into and purchased said cheese from Amazon. The supplier who sent it, did a great job of packing and was prompt in delivery. It is a very nice cheese.', \"This is one of my favorite coffees. I used to buy it ground in bags locally but they stopped carrying it. It's smooth, light and not bitter at all. Beautiful caramel/nutty undertones give it a very nice after taste.

Now, she eats the whole helping in less than 30 seconds.  She really seems to like this food.  I will be sticking to this brand it looks like.\", 'This is definitely my all time favorite flavored Keurig k-cup.  Pretty much tastes like a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks.', 'Our daughter is 9 months old and loves this food. She can sometimes eat a whole container at one sitting!In addition to it being organic and having interesting flavor combinations (without getting too bold with the spices, which can turn our daughter off), I like that the food contains salba seed. According to my research, salba is fibrous and absorbs water, so it helps with digestion. If your child tends toward constipation, as ours sometimes does, this can really help move things along without being harsh. I also like the combinations of fruit and veg used in these pouches, which keeps the food from being overly sweet yet makes some of the trickier vegs more appealing.We have tried four different kinds of the Happy Tot pouches and all of them, even the one with peas in it, have passed the test. She actually gets excited when she sees one of us coming with a pouch in our hands!I make it a point to taste everything that I am feeding to our daughter. I think these foods taste good and have no reservations about giving them to her.', 'I use so much of this and it is so convienient to get this by the case.', \"I decided to get this item for my new shelter dog.  He went through dog toys like mad and most dog chews would be swallowed whole, only to be puked up later on.  I was trying to find a product that he would get excited about chewing on and wouldn't be destroyed within minutes.  Boy did this fit the bill!  He has had it for well over a month now and has not even made his way through 25% of it yet.  It doesn't have a smell and it hasn't broke off into pieces.

Just use this Cinnamon Matcha instead, and whisk it in hot water.  You'll be gulping it up at record speed!  It is so yummy!Yeah, yeah, I know, that's not the idea behind the cinnamon challenge.  But, I assure you - this is much easier to swallow in 30 seconds, and better for you too.  (Yes, cinnamon is good for you, but it is very questionable, indeed, whether or not its healthy for you to swallow a teaspoon of dry, ground cinnamon.)This is really delicious.  The cinnamon is a spicy-sweet kind of cinnamon, reminiscent of Saigon cinnamon.  Very zesty - it enlivens the palate with its warm, exotic spice.

You can use either the seasoned rice vinegar which is sweet or the original, and go easy on the sesame oil, it is very strong and can overpower your dish. We also add a bit of canola oil, just a suggestion. I originally had these noodles at the Luau, a wonderful restaurant that we went to when I was a child and I have loved them ever since. Wonderful texture and take on the flavors you imbue them with. They can also be fried in very hot canola or peanut oil for a crunch in salads...very versatile and great to have on hand.

I do not know why they stopped selling it there, but ever since, It has been hard to find, and ever harder to find it fresh.  I am so thankful I have found it for sale on this web site.  I overnighted a box the other day, and as soon as itt showed up  I immediately ate two of the 3.5 ounce bags for lunch.  Looks like I will be making another order shortly.', 'My wife brought home a box of Barry's Gold Blend Tea from a Celtic specialty shop here in Anchorage, Alaska.  I drink about 3 to 5 cups of tea each day and was used to domestic, \"super market\" brands of tea.  I was impressed with Barry's deep rich, almost sweet, flavor and quickly used up the box she bought. The local price here made me shy away from buying Barry's very often but found more reasonable sellers  via the internet. I was pleased to find Amazon as a source with free shipping it makes my Barry's tea habit less of a guilty pleasure.  Try a cuppa, I think you will find it a bonny brew', \"I buy these for my friends who don't smoke and the nicotine makes them sick from some of my other shisha.

I even mix them with other things and they still amaze me with how much flavor they give off.\", 'Bought these for my mother online because she can no longer find this particular Murray cookie at the local stores.

I love it - wish it were sold in larger quantities.  I'll be using this a lot for baking.\", \"I first had this popcorn at my 84 year old cousin's home. I thought it was so tender and delicious, and I wanted to buy some for myself. I found it on Amazon.com believe it or not!!!  Anyway, I ordered 6 pounds of it. All 6 pounds are now gone. This popcorn is REALLY good. It is different than other popcorns I have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate. I consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because I have eaten it every night since I was a little girl. I usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time, but since the kernels are so small, I ate it by the handful. My only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped. I wish I could find it locally so I would not have to pay for the shipping costs. If you like popcorn, I highly recommend it.\", \"This product is definitely a hit with my two finicky cats.  One is 9 years old, the other is 2 years old.  I was trying to find a natural, yet affordable wet cat food for my boys because I noticed that their feces was carrying a potent odor.  I read many sites which suggested natural food, which is better for their digestive system and ultimately fecal odor (as I use natural cat litter without perfumes or deorderizers).  This product has definitely helped me to achieve my goal.  While the litter box is not odor free, the odor has significantly reduced.  The food is super moist and has a good portion of watery natural juice (not gravy), which they like to sop up before eating the food itself.  This is good, as my older boy doesn't like to drink much water.I also notice that my boys do not get as hungry after eating this food.  With my old, highly commercialized brand, they would each eat 3 portions per day.  With this new food, they stay full for most of the day, only needing 2 portions per day, which is even more savings in my book!  Definitely a plus!I highly recommend this product.  It's a great deal when purchased with Subscribe and Save.  I say, at least give it a try.  If you don't want to commit to a full case, see if any pet stores like PetSmart of Petco have single cans so that you can try it out with your cat(s).  You may also want to try a few flavors to see which are their favs.  If it's a hit, make sure to Subscribe and Save on Amazon!  I haven't found anyone to beat their prices!Good luck!\", \"I've been looking to find a new brand, I thus came to Amazon, bought it based on the reviews, and to my surprise, I like it, mind you, if feeding kids, a little sliced up or dried fruit go a long way, as it is slightly bland.

But I can see myself sticking with it.\", 'Having just purchased my next 12-pack of the \"5-hour ENERGY\" shots [Hours of energy now~No crash later] from Amazon.com, I can say with great certainty, that for less than $1.65/shot, I receive at least 4.5 hours of continuous energy, which enables me to begin and finish any project that I set my mind to. I'm always in a more 'chirpy and contented' mood, and this supplement never leaves me jangled, jittery, or crashing, the way most caffeine-laced products do--no running to the bathroom for frequent potty-breaks, either.

I wish they had a slightly richer flavor, but that's a problem with all water process decaf, so I can't blame them... it has plenty of flavor, just not that sweet depth that I love, which the Senseo dark roast caffeinated pods do have, but they make me jittery.\", 'These Truffles were delicious and the product was fresh on arrival. I have seen some comments where this product in particular was either old or seemed to be stale. Not in my case! Trade Concepts did an outstanding job of packaging the truffels and took great care to ensure the product arrived in superb condition. They put it in a special packaging material to prevent it from going bad in shipment too! I love Godiva Truffels and was so happy they arrived and tasted as good as I remember.

This coffee enticed me as it is all natural and the caramel flavoring comes from caramelizing sugar which is subtle yet smoothly delicious as it adds a rich buttery flavor that comes through cup after cup.My mom does not drink anything but Folgers but when she came by for lunch she asked for coffee and I handed her a cup of this blend since I had brewed it for me and she loved it.She even took the remainder of the bag home to enjoy.  That alone impressed me!  I have tried the cinnamon & the vanilla natural fusions and did not like them as much as this one. This is the only one I will buy again to enjoy on chilly fall evenings.', 'I tried my first Equal Exchange bar yesterday. The cocoa flavor is deep and lingers in the mouth, the mark of a good chocolate, beyond what you would expect from the middling 38% cocoa content (most premium milk chocolate starts at 40%, 50% is common and there are some bars with 60% cocoa). The fact their cacao is sourced from Latin America helps, as South America is the ancestral home of cacao, and American cacao (specially from Venezuela, Ecuador and Trinidad) tends to be better than the industrial forastero grades grown in Africa or Indonesia. This chocolate was also conched properly, with a very smooth texture. The hazelnuts it is blended with are hard to discern, however. They may contribute to the smoothness.This is world-class chocolate. I would not hesitate to put it in the same company as the best from Valrhona, Cluizel, Guittard or Hachez. The price is relatively moderate for premium chocolate.I tend to be suspicious of the Fairtrade label. Their certification is expensive, and most of the money goes to pay Western experts than the poor farmers it purports to help. I tried \"Divine\" brand chocolates, as the company is actually owned by cocoa farmers in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, but was disappointed with grainy and fairly insipid bars. The good thing about Equal Exchange is the product stands on its own, even before the feel-good factor.', \"After visiting an English tea house and having my first earl grey lavender blend, I searched for similar product and did not come close until purchasing this loose leaf tea.  The REV tea did not cut it for me and I was disappointed until I came across this brand.  The Earl Grey caffiene is an effective energy boost, but the lavender also has a Zen calming effect --this might seem contradictory.  To further explain, I use this to wake up in the morning and it allows me to productive in a calm manner without the frantic panic that can sometimes come from having too much caffeine.  This tea is a great value per ounce compared to bagged tea.  A little goes a long way.  In fact, a little pinch appears to expand to 7X it's volume after puttting in the water -- besides the flower bud tea I have had, I have not seen this amount of expansion in other teas before and definatly not the expansion I have seen from any bagged tea.  Very pleasant taste.  I don't get the reviews about too much lavender. Earl Grey is a very strong tea and the lavender has to be strong to not get buried under the flavor of the Earl Grey.\", \"This stuff is pretty tasty- I was thinking it would be more like squirt, but turns out a little more like sprite or 7-up.

In fact, having tasted nearly every coffee offered by Gevalia (of which I am a subscriber, and have been for years), I can say San Francisco Bay Coffee rivals even some of the seasonal/limited edition coffees from Gevalia.For anyone snobbish enough to bad-mouth the quality of this coffee, if one is really such a connoisseur of coffee, one should also know enough to keep the bag tightly closed and preferably in the freezer.I wish this family-owned company the best of luck, kudos on meeting a market need in such a delicious way, and PLEASE offer subscriptions in 2- or 3-week intervals!  36ct. will not last me a full month!Protip: Store in an emtpy resealable plastic coffee container in the freezer.EDIT: Looks to me as though someone was dissatisfied with the coffee (for some reason...maybe poor taste) and reinforced their lack of taste by systematically voting every 5-star rating as Unhelpful.

You do not have to do that if you have a hand mixer with some guts.  Just use soft butter or butter substitute.  Also, watch how long they cook as mine never need the full time.

Also, the price is far better for Honey Maid graham crackers than it is for Stacy's pita chips.In any case, these cinnamon graham crackers are a great substitute for Stacy's pita chips.  The cinnamon crackers are a favorite of mine to grab as a snack with a tall glass of cold skim milk.  They have a satisfying crunch to them when I bite into them, though I could do without the crumbs all over.

My puppy seems to prefer them to his chew toys as his number one chewing item...  He will chew on one for an hour, and it seems to help his teething and some anxiety. They do have a slight smell, but nothing overpowering, and his strong preference for them makes it well worth it. They also seem to last a very long time (after a week or so, we are still on the first stick, and it looks to last at least another week or two).I did notice today that on rare occasions, the dog can pull at thr side of the strip and get a stringy bit that's probably more than he should swallow...  This very rarely happens (ive only seen it once in a week), but it goes without saying, if possible keep an eye on the dog while he's chewing on these, just in case.\", 'a must for all cats especially outdoor to eliminate  urinary problems...works well for pet health...no infections since commencment of purina diet...', 'Devine dark chocolate.

It's unfortunate that even in some formulas there are HFCS. It's unbelievable. So these pouches are great being organic and healthy.The true benefit though is the packaging. These are so convenient to use on the go.We made a trip to Disneyland, and these pouches were a life saver. In the past, we've used just a little container and a spoon to feed the baby, but it really ends up being a mess. On the trip, the baby could just snack on the food straight from the pouch with hardly any mess (we would hold the pouch so it wouldn't get messy).You take the green cap off and then it's perfect for the baby to just suck on it and get the baby food out.Highly recommended for using when you're on a trip or in a restaurant and the baby wants some food, but you don't want to create a mess.\", 'I ordered the King Cake mix so that I could bake my own cake for Mardi Gras.

Her favorite of all green teas is Uncle Lee's Organic Green Tea. She will drink others if she has to, but she doesn't enjoy any other tea half as much as this one. I have made it a habit to buy the 4-pack of 100s from Amazon to keep her in stock as she drinks 4-6 cups of this stuff every day. For taste, nothing compares to Uncle Lee's Organic Green Tea.

You can taste the cinnamon in it and the rose hips make it naturally sweet. Really a wonderful flavor.

That's what keeps this mix lively and fun, just a variety is nice. This mix was also rich enough that the bag lasted me a long time while even being able to share it. This is a perfect mix, and I hope to see more varieties in the future!My advice is that you give the bag a good mix, even better if in a bowl, otherwise you end up eating all the pretzels and cookies before the m and ms and peanuts.The perfect summer/movie snack!\", 'I haven't written reviews, only 1 or 2.

Bones, I tried one pack, but relized after seeing how good they are, I checked Amazon, and sure enough, they sold them, and at a better price.Our Vet said when dogs reach 4 to 5 years old, regular rawhide does grind/chip their back teeth. That worrid me, but Vet said they're not bad, and introducted me to C.E.T. bones.  Dogs have been on them for long time now, and I continue, oftened, to buy C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral... chews.And when so much time passed, and recently Vet both dogs teeth, the older dog, her teeth are the same, they arn't worse.  That to me is GREAT.  Now I order from whoever has the better prices for C.E.T. chews.  (NOTE:-I would check, though, make sure if you want to try these, make sure if you order $25.00 or over, that there's NO POSTAGE, some are 3rd parties, some 3rd parties offer free postage.  Just letting all the Dog lovers know this.)We've been using these Chews for so long, and when it's time to give each of them one, all I say is \"how about a 'Chewy Bone'....WOW, no matter where they are in the house, they come a running, right to the closet in kitchen where I store them.  They also, when I open the pantry, they run to other room, next to kitchen, and sit and wait, while their tails wag alot.  That, at least to me, tells me they really like them.So for anyone out there who wants to know what I think.....I think these C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral ARE THE BEST, and I would NOT recommend any other chewy bones, especially rawhide, or any other hard bone.If this previous isn't enough to convince you, I don't know what else to say, other than \"Maybe you should at least try 1 bag, even if you pay postage.  I bet after that 1 bag, depending on size, which I buy the 30 extra large, which is much better price, they have small, medium, the right sizes for any dogs.That's about it.

The first morning i put Canidae in his dish (at 5:30am) he scarfed the entire bowl down in a matter of minutes!!!!! It was such a relief to know that my dog was actually enjoying his food.Now i feed him once in the morning and once at night and he eats every bit as soon as I put it down everytime.

I prefer not to eat it by the spoonful because of the consistency, but really like spreading it on a graham cracker, the taste of which reminds me of coconut cream pie with a graham cracker crust. I also like cooking with it, and didn't notice coconut-tasting chicken. I recently ordered a larger amount of coconut oil and tried a different brand, but I prefer the Nature's Way flavor. I'll use the other brand as a moisturizing cream, and order more of the Nature's Way for eating and cooking.

They are durable enough that pieces don't break off and there is minimal risk of choking.  They seem to last forever but are soft enough that the dogs want to chew on them.  I bought the largest size because I have medium and large sized dogs.  That also minimizes risk of choke and/or other injury.  They are also easy to spot in the yard when mowing the grass.  If you do accidentally run one over, they break or splinter and leave sharp edges.  I would remove them from your dogs yard in that event.  Otherwise, the dogs seem to like them (are willing to pick them up, take them from you, and carry them around) and chew on them quite often.

And when I got home I still had some work to do and needed a boost to get me through it.After hearing a radio ad for this product, I picked up a two-pack and used one of them when I got home.It promised five hours of energy without crashing. I can't attest to the five hours (didn't quite pay attention), but it did last for quite a while and I had no crash effect in the end. I wasn't overly anxious or nervous, but I could think clearly and get the work done that I needed to get done. So it most definately delivers on its promises.The things that I like the most is the fact that there is no sugar. I also appreciate the fact that they use water instead of carbonated water, which is the main reason I don't like the Monsters, Rockstar, Red Bull, etc products (diet versions, of course). It also gives all this energy in 2 ounces instead of having to drink a large soda can worth of drink. The taste wasn't fantastic, but it could have been much worst and only takes a good gulp to get it all down.I've been looking for a product like this to get me going in the mornings and this seems to fit the bill. My only problem with this is that it is a bit on the pricey side. Today I am also trying out one that is similar, called Enduroshot, a 2.2 ounce energy shot that claims all the same benefits that this promises but at a MUCH lower price. I'll do a review on that sometime soon in the future. If I feel just as awake and alert as I do with 5-hour energy, then I will use it instead.

The bottle has a description on it as \"A difference you can taste.\" This  can be true, but I've been drinking different bottled waters over the years and I must say there is a smoothness that I do notice. It kind of reminds me of my youth in summer camp in the Pocono Mountains of PA. There was a stream that was fed by a rubber pipe in the ground. This has that heavy smooth cold taste that I always remembered. Nothing before, has reminded me of that experience. Am I imagining it, I don't think so. It really is different.I like the water very much. I was only given one bottle to evaluate. I can't talk to any long term benefits of the pH or electrolytes that are in the water. It's very good water and I'll leave it to you if the price is worth it to you.

The price on Amazon is less than the ones in the supermarkets, too.We love these raisins straight out of the box, on our cereals, or in our recipes.  We have used them in some of our recipes in The Collard Patch. We buy these often and keep them handy. As grocery prices continue to grow, we are careful to give ourselves little treats like these raisins, which we consider a gourmet product -- actually fit for royalty -- to keep us content with our frugal way of life.Nutritionally they are an excellent source of dietary fiber, energy, and potassium.In 2007, we bought a box of Sun Maid California Golden Raisins that did not measure up to our standards.  Although the raisins were tasty, the box had about 20% dark raisins.  We wrote the Sun Maid Company and expressed our disappointment.  Evidently this occurrence was something they did not expect or accept.  They told us that there is no way to avoid having a few dark raisins in the box but that this box was not representative of their fine product.

I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.

We weren't expecting much, and we certainly weren't expecting her to suck it down happily and hungrily!  We've stopped fighting with her to take the bottle - what a relief that mealtimes aren't a battle anymore and she's not fussy all day from hunger.  We thought the Alimentum and Nutramigen were the same, but obviously they aren't because our picky little eater won't touch the Alimentum but loves the Nutramigen.

I loveee it  I take one to work every morning', 'I'll apologize in advance for the length of this review, but it's more of a story than a review.After adopting a five-year-old Golden Retriever last year, I had to spend a few hundred dollars to have her teeth professionally cleaned.  She had a lot of staining on her front teeth and canines and a lot of hard calculus on her large premolars.  (See image I posted above for reference.) The vet had to remove one of her large bottom premolars due to the amount of decay.  After the surgery, I committed to brushing her teeth two to three times per week, but that wasn't enough.  The tartar and calculus came back within months.  I began to get concerned that I'd have to get her teeth cleaned again and they'd have to (eventually) remove her other large, bottom premolar.  (Imagine a dog without its bottom premolars!) Despite my rigorous brushing, the calculus would not come off.  Going against the advice of many vets, I BBQ'd a slab of beef ribs and let her chew on them, but she refused to gnaw on them.  She'd remove the meat and leave the bone. I then went to the pet store and spent about $20 on an assortment of chewable bones in hopes one of them would do the trick. The first one I gave her was the Purina Busy Bone.  She went right at it and consumed almost the whole thing within 20 minutes.  I let her consume the rest of it the following day, but didn't expect to see a difference so fast, so I didn't inspect her teeth immediately.  A couple days later while brushing her teeth, I couldn't believe how much of the calculus was gone.  I was so relieved that I wouldn't have to get her teeth professionally cleaned again and that I'd found something safe and effective to keep her tartar and calculus at bay.  I committed to buying several of these while they were on sale.The only downside to these Busy Bones is that they get really sticky when wet.  Your dog's paws and legs WILL be sticky after chewing on one of these, so be prepared.  Either let them do it outside or plan on wiping their legs afterwards.  (It's a small price to pay, though.)I really feel for the guy with the corgi whose dog almost choked when the Busy Bone became lodged (see review titled, \"Dangerous Choking Hazard\").  As a result, I will certainly monitor my dog while she's chewing on these in the future.Good luck everyone.', \"These pretzels are one of our favorite gluten free snacks.

I agree with the reviewer who recommended reading the labels; I am a 'label reader' and I too noticed the \"Supplemental Feeding\" on the appetizers. These, as well as the other wet foods, are either mixed in to a dry (also all natural preservative free) cat food, or given as a treat between meals.My spoiled rotten Princess of a  cat loves these.

My grades rose significantly, and I can actually pay attention in class. Just yesterday, I managed to power through the day with only 2 hours of sleep and 1 ounce of 5-Hour Energy.

Very little needed for pan frying and adds a subtle but tasty flavor to vegetables.', \"I absolutely love Click! I have tried several protein drinks, wasted tons of money and were are all gross! I can tolerate two and Click is one of them. It's smooth and the coffee flavor covers up the protein flavor for the most part. I add a little sugar free syrup or a dash of pumpkin spice and a little pumpkin and I have a satisfying drink that wont take 500 calories out of my day. I do use a Magic Bullet to mix mine though, but with that I have never had an issue with mixing it. I have also never tried it warm, so I can't comment on that either. I have been a loyal customer for over a year now and will likely remain so.\", \"I use these bars (macadamia and apricot are my favorite) as meal replacements on the go.

The great thing about this drink is all of the vitamins (I'm not good about taking a multivitamin...).  I drink this fairly diluted; with at least 32 ounces of water instead of 16 ounces and the flavor is just right.  The citrus is my favorite and, sadly, they don't carry that at Costco anymore.

It has a hint of the original Market Spice flavor in it (the tell tale cloves and orange)  but not enough to take the flavor as a whole out of the \"Breakfast\" realm nor make it so you can't add milk if you like.

Not as much flavor. Back to almond-walnut-macadamia bars.I've gone through a few boxes of the KIND bars named for their alleged content of almonds, walnuts, and macadamias. I haven't encountered any of the funny tastes, apparent staleness, or wrappers horribly stuck to the bars, that some reviewers have mentioned. As other reviewers point out, there are a lot of peanuts relative to the content of walnuts, macadamias, and walnuts. But it tastes good nonetheless, and for the price ($1.06 per bar if you buy on subscription) it  strikes me as a good value. This is a relatively high-calorie snack bar (almost 200 cal), but it's also high protein (10g), has extremely little saturated fat, and a relatively low amount of sugar. It's substantial enough that you can easily resist eating a second bar. The bars also contain some worthy vitamins and minerals in amounts sufficient to matter.

When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over.

This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a \"clean\" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.

People tend to make the mistake of thinking that because Miso is soy based it will be salty when mixed with liquid but this is less often the case. You can add soy sauce or Tamari for salt purpose, Miso is just the base. I saw a review that panned this Eden Shiro Miso, Organic Rice & Soybean, 12.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3) but Miso and Rice are about the most bland combination you can start with and must be seasoned to taste. That's why I start with this Barley mix, it has a more robust flavor to begin with but making Miso is about finding the base flavor that you like beyond the seasoning which comes later (some might prefer a thinner rice base). So in sum this Miso Barley has a strong flavor, holds up well to just about any use including thicker sauces and can provide a lot of base when mixed into soup.\", 'I had high hopes when I ordered this supplement, purportedly for one of my sons who was having some transitional stress issues...but I needed it as much (if not more.)

The answer is brushing (which is always good regardless of whether your dog chews or not!) and not much else.While at the vet I saw the CET Enzymatic HEXTRA Premium chews. $30 a bag for 30 chews.

Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews for Large Dogs, 30 Chews.\" It's not completely clear what the exact differences between these and the HEXTRA Premiums, but the chews do smell different (I think this has to do with the chicken flavoring on these which the Premiums don't have).And it turns out Baird loves these as well.One thing to remember is that if your dog has yellowed teeth, simple chews won't fix that. All you can do is get those teeth deep cleaned... however, this is just generally surface staining, so brushing and providing chews like these will actually clear the plaque. And the plaque is the part you are worried about, given that's what can cause health problems with your dogs.Over all, I'm happy that Baird's happy with these chews. If you can't brush your dog's teeth all the time, these make an OK alternative to brushing. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P05K7W\">C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews with Chlorhexidine, Large Dogs, 30 Chews</a> are available as well, they are just a few dollars more. Next time I order I will most likely go with the Premiums out of nothing more than personal preference.', 'This is basically a Velveeta version of Hamburger Helper Cheeseburger Mac, which if you add extra seasonings, is pretty good along with being a cheap meal. I have to say Hamburger Helper has just met its match.You cook up the hamburger the same way, add in water, a seasoning package, and then the noodles. Then, when the water is absorbed, you add in a package of Velveeta cheese. YUMMY!! It really made the meal pop with a great cheesy flavor without being too cheesy, a problem that I commonly have when cooking with Velveeta.I also like the fact that the macaroni noodles were a larger noodle. Typically you get little elbow macaroni noodles in the Hamburger Helper. That just added to the filling meal.I recommend this. It comes out to be about $2.50 a box when ordered off Amazon, which is cheaper than buying Hamburger Helping in the store. It is a good, hearty meal good for any family.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVDs.', 'A friend of mine recently brought some of this back with her from Seattle.

We are both partial to the dark cherry flavor. Texture is also really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. You don't have to sit there chewing forever, but if you want u can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect!

I was very pleased with these noodles, I have had other Shirataki noodles before (can't remember the brand exactly) but these were much better. Don't be alarmed at the horrid smell when you open the pouch (I certainly was lol), that as I understand it, is the odor given off by the presearving agent, and has no affect on the taste of the noodle. Simply rinse them thoroughly in a collander until the smell is gone/extremely faint. Once boiled as instructed the smell will not be present in the noodle, and as I said the noodles do not taste like that smell. Miracle Noodles are completely flavorless and the texture of this brand is much more palatable than the other brand I tried. I think the Miracle noodles are akin to \"Ramen\" noodles as far as texture goes (this only applies to the angel hair variety, I have not tried other shapes). I had these with my homemade tomato sauce and they took on the flavor of the sauce entirely. I love them, I will deffinately be ordering them again.

I can imagine Colas tasted like this in the early 1900s - its everything a Cola should be.Boylan doesn't compromise on anything.  They only sell their products in glass bottles to preserve an authentic taste.

I didn't want to have the mess on the rugs (or smell) of real rawhide, and I didn't want to worry about bone chips with regular bone treats. These are our guys' FAVORITE treat, hands down. To make them last longer overall, you can bend and break them into small pieces (which I always do), and simply give them as a smaller treat, vs. giving them the entire 'slice' of sweet potato as they come packaged in the bag. Even though they don't last for hours like a \"rawhide\" does, I just don't care. I've had my fill of trying to keep the dogs in one tiled area with their chews / bones so that they don't get crud on the carpet or rugs (that I have to clean!). With this product, you have: (1) a super healthy treat (2) something that doesn't have the risk of bone chips (although of course, I don't give them these treats and leave the house -- and I don't do that with any treat) (3) a treat that does NOT stain the carpet or rugs (at ALL!), or rub off or stain your dog's fur (4) a treat that is made from dried sweet potatoes and ONLY that ... no preservatives, no 'animal parts', no artificial colors, no chemicals, no other \"mystery\" ingredients that you can't identify - just 100% dried sweet potatoes.

I was hoping at least Amazon would have some, but no.To any consumers out there, I can bake just about anything, I make fantastic cookies on my own.  All other store brands save this one, and ONLY this one, pale in comparison to my homemade cookies.  These are like the perfect balance of goowiness and crunch.

No worries there; these are still just exactly as always - great, fresh, crisp, satisfying and healthy chips.I've had these chips in both the salted and unsalted varieties, and both are good.  They also make some with different flavors; one of my favorites has sesame seeds added.  They make other types of corn chips too, such as yellow corn chips (I particularly like the small round shaped ones).I purchased these via Amazon.com from the company VitaCost.  They did an A+ job of rapidly shipping and extremely careful packaging - the best packaging I've seen in any product I've ordered off Amazon, actually.  The chips arrived in perfect condition (well, all bags of chips will have a few broken pieces at the bottom, but these weren't any more broken than ones you get at the local grocery store).

I asked her how she seasoned them and such was my introduction to this secret weapon. I've been a member of Costco for a while but never even noticed this spice (probably b/c of the \"no-salt\" on the label - I know it's bad for me but I love me some salt)I usually season my white rice by adding some garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, salt and butter while it's cooking. It's nice but I wouldn't just eat a bowl of it by itself.

They might be an acquired taste, but to be honest, I personally prefer it to the alternatives that taste too much like candy bars to made me feel as though I've had a satisfying snack. My main word of caution is to not buy these as a snack for a road trip, a day of big meetings, or similar situation in which you can't necessarily control your bathroom access; the high amount of fiber will make you want to be flexible with that.\", 'I love Popchips!!

I do not consume copious amounts of potato chips, however, I do occasionally pack my kids lunch with the salty tubers. My family enjoys the Popchips so much, that I purchased a variety pack of 24 (0.8oz bags) from Amazon.  They taste very good and the texture is wonderful, although I will admit they are a bit salty.  I really enjoy the salt and pepper flavor the best, with the salt and vinegar coming in a close second.

It has a rich nutty flavor and is a good source of fiber.  I sometimes blend in a little more wild rice  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5OMA\">Lundberg Organic Wild Rice, 8-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>  You can also make your own custom blends with various Lundberg rices.Ca $20 for 6 bags, w free shipping on orders >$25 (the price at the time of this writing) is a good deal.The only problem is that it can be hard to cook it just right.  Oddly, most published rice cooking instructions produce wet undercooked rice for me.  The following is my formula which works just right for any brown rice.  It produces firm dry, but fully cooked, rice, which is particularly ideal for mixing with cooked meat and/or vegetables (e.g., stir fry) or adding to soups immediately before serving.  To cook white rice, just alter the time to 15--20 minutes.COOKING INSTRUCTIONS1) add 1 1/2 cups of water to an uncovered 2 1/2 quart sausepan2) on HIGH bring the water to a boil, in the meantime measure 1 cup of rice.3) as soon as the water begins to boil, turn the stove OFF (or take the pot off the burner), add the rice, and stir*4) set the stove burner to LOW, set a timer for 30-40 minutes, and cover5) when the timer goes off, immediately remove from the stove, uncover, stir and \"fluff up\" the rice with a plastic spatula, and leave uncovered for 1/2 hour.6) after a half-hour, cover the rice until time to eat it.*If you simply dump rice into a pot of boiling water, and slap a lid on it, it will boil over and make a mess---you need to let the burner (particularly if ceramic) and pot (particular if heavy) cool down a little before you put the lid on.  The quickest and easiest way is to simply turn the burner off for the few seconds it takes to stir in the rice.DO NOT SUBSTITUTE BROTH FOR THE WATER; DO NOT ADD BUTTER OR OIL---you'll almost certainly get wet, undercooked, rice.  If you want to add flavor, add olive oil or butter, and Braggs Aminos or bullion AFTER the rice is fully cooked.CAUTIONOn my glass-top (Kitchen Aide) range, I've found that I cannot cook ANYTHING simultaneously with the rice.  If the oven or ANY other burner is in use (or if the stove is merely warm from recent use), the temperature sensing circuitry of the range turns off the burner with the rice, with the result that the rice is undercooked.SALVAGING UNDERCOOKED RICEYou can't just put the rice back on the burner---you'll get glop.  Assuming that you started with 1 cup of dry rice:  Pack the rice into a 24oz covered casserole, for example <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MZPII\">Marinex 23.7-Ounce Small Round Casserole with Lid</a> and microwave for 5 minutes.  The result will be PERFECT rice.  Really!!!  IT REALLY WORKS!!!COOKING IN A MICROWAVEAdd 1 cup dry rice and 1/2 cup water to a 24oz covered casserole, microwave 5 minutes(at \"low\" or half-power).  Add another 1/2 water, microwave 5 minutes(at \"low\" or half-power).  Add the third 1/2 cup water and microwave 5 minutes(at \"low\" or half-power).General Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.To see my, \"How to Cook Rice\" for more detailsclick on \"See all my reviews\" above, then click on \"So you'd like to know\" guides on the left side of the page', \"I put two tea bags in a gallon Mason jar, and add a half cup or so of Davidson's cranberry orange bulk tea.

The crunchy bars are not too sweet, have a nice maple brown sugar flavor, and are well wrapped and sealed for carrying in all types of weather.Another variety that we enjoy are the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMQFY4\">Nature Valley Chewy Trail Mix Bars</a> in the Fruit & Nut flavor. These are nicely chewy, with a nice oat flavor, and can be gentler on the mouth the crunchier varieties. If you're counting carbs and calories, these are listed as having total carbohydrates of 25g and 140 calories. For our purposes, they're ideal for our frequent cycling activities.Either type of these granola bars is just filling enough to satisfy mild food cravings, and they're decent between meal snacks for kids or fairly active adults. Some say that teenagers and adults rarely concur on many things, but in our agreed opinion, these are a pretty even match in overall enjoyment. In our case, we usually get both.But crunchy or chewy, either is a good snack choice.', 'I was going to buy powder gatorade, but opted to go with this instead for my road cycling hydration. The first day I used it, I was amazing. I went further than I had ever gone, and felt like I could just keep going (but had to stop because I ran out of daylight). This is a great product! I would highly recommend purchasing it to use for any athletic activities!', \"yesterday, Nov. 2, 2011, we received a carton - contents being (3) three 24-can packs.this carton was very loosely packed - one small roll of airbags, which didn't make the 3 pkgs. stay tightly together. as a result, one pack of 24 cans was dented - even one can was opened from the pressure of the cans being thrown against each other.I was quite surprised at the condition it was in. we receive many cartons from Amazon.com - - all of them previously have arrived in perfect condition; thus my surprise at the less than perfect shape. just wanted to let you know, someone isn't doing their job.Betty A.

The reason? It does not taste \"instant\". Rather, it tastes like a freshly brewed, dark, strong, rich cup of real coffee. For a less \"potent\" taste, packets should be used in venti-sized cups or rationed for more than one regular cup. This is an excellent product.', 'Traditional Medicinals Tea, Green Organic is the most smooth and gentle tea that I have ever tried.  I tend to suffer heartburn from some green teas but not this one. I highly recomment it.  It is also a great buy!', \"I adore this coconut oil.  It smells incredible, tastes delicious, and adds a lovely sheen to your skin.  I put this on my face before washing it to clean off makeup and regularly use this as a body lotion after showering and to remove eye makeup.  It makes your skin wonderfully soft and yummy-smelling and doesn't have any difficult to pronounce ingredients like regular body lotions do.Also, I use this as a topping for air-popped popcorn (since it's oil, it doesn't have water and doesn't make popcorn soggy - butter does this), and I put it on bread in place of butter since it melts faster and is tasty, and I use it in the pan to cook stir-fry, eggs, and anything else I want to cook!  All in all, this stuff is awesome!  I just wish it came in a better container, but as soon as I run out I'll buy another jug of Nutiva coconut oil (this is my second one).\", \"These are great candy bars.

The price was good and the candy is fresh and delicious. I definitely will buy from this seller again and recommend them.\", \"My wife and I really love these Planters Big Nut Bars. We're generally fans of chewy granola bars and we also love peanuts, cashews, and almonds ... so these granola bars seem like they were made for us. The nuts are fresh and provide a little bit of crunchiness and the granola and caramel give these quite a bit of chewiness as well.My wife thinks they're perfect, but I think the caramel flavor overpowers the nut flavor a bit too much and that the bars are on the edge of being too chewy (if you try to pull a piece of the bar off then the whole bar starts to fall apart because it's so chewy).Still, I really like these granola bars and my wife and I will definitely buy more of these.\", \"My dog loves Greenies treats, so I ordered him a big box for his Christmas gift.

For most of her life she ate only canned food, and it seemed mean to switch her to a completely dry diet at this late date. However, we wanted to make sure she was getting good nutrition in her old age, and not too many calories. She seems to like this mixture, and has lost some of her excess pounds over the past few years. She still needs medication for arthritis, but carrying a little less weight has to help the strain on her joints somewhat. It's a bit cheaper than both an all-canned-food diet and the prescription dry food we'd tried buying from our vet.It's readily available at our supermarket and at discount stores, so why did I buy it here on Subscribe and Save? It's the kind of thing I've run out of one too many times, and I like the idea of it arriving automatically. Also, unless it's on sale, the supermarket price isn't that great and sometimes it's completely out of stock. It's a better price at places like Target and Pet Smart, but I really don't need any extra errands right now. I just hope it comes back in stock here in time for my next S&S shipment!\", 'This was sent as a gift.  More than once I was told how happily they munched on these.

She hasn't gotten sick from it or shows any signs of being sick. A few weeks ago she got a clean bill of health from the vet, so I know there is nothing in this food that is potentially harmful. I really like this food, and the fact that is doesn't have any animal by-products is a plus. I would recommend Newman's Own Dry Cat Food.\", 'This roast is delicious--clear, bold and sharp.  Although everyone we interact with has their favorite k-cup we all agree this is absolutely wonderful.', 'This coffee is like none I have ever had. For starters, it comes in a bag, like tea.

It left me feeling cleansed.', \"My son-in-law, who is a superb cook, went back to the kitchen and cooked burgers in the oven.  When he served them, I kept looking out to see if  the grill on the porch had been uncovered. I couldn't understand how he had that authentic Texas smoky taste in the oven.  I wondered how he flavored the burgers to get that taste of tomatoes, mustard, pepper, and vineagar just right.  There was a hint of molasses too.  The burgers were big, beautiful, and juicy.He pulled out the Char Crust box.  I was amazed that something this delicious could have come from a box.\", 'My dogs and I love this food.

Fit the bill exactly, and very reasonably priced.', \"Having started cooking wild rice 20 plus years ago when I suppose it was just becoming widely available and the gourmet market was just beginning to open up, I know something about wild rice. Now, thanks to the internet, I don't have to travel to far off Minnesota or buy tiny expensive packets in the local health food cooperative. There's plenty of wild rice available for anyone who wants it these days, but as the demand has grown, the industry has changes. A lot of wild rice isn't really wild anymore. It's farmed in rice paddies. And a lot of wild rice is dried in industrial drums fueled by propane, much the same way coffee is roasted. You'll see a lot of dark black, hard rice sold as wild rice. Maybe that's all you've ever seen.Bineshii still does it the old fashioned way. The rice is wild, harvested by canoe, slow dried over a wood fire. The result is a flavorful, tender, ultra-long grain that has a light nut-brown color and a delicacy no other rice can match. It's so tender, you don't even need to cook it. You can soak it overnight in water and it will soak up enough water to become edible raw -- sort of like pasta al dente. It really comes into its glory when you cook it though, with wonderful curled sweet nutty grains that are so delicious I hate to serve it as a side dish. I usually just eat the rice and nothing else. That's how good it is!Bineshii is a group of Native Americans and they do more than just rice. They make preserves, soap, totems, kinnick kinnick, birch bark art pieces, and even have an instant mix Ojibwe fry bread, if you have a hankering. It's worth your while just to browse their website for a bit. The bottom line is that this is the best authentic wild rice I have found.\", 'I bought this for my sister because she has been wanting to try it for so long so I thought it would be the perfect Christmas present.  She loves it.  Says it tastes just like peanut butter (and that was coming from when she just ate it off a spoon and only mixed with water).  I like it also, but I still think all natural peanut butter tastes better, but this is great for smoothies because the \"peanut butter\" doesn't stick to the blades making a very messy clean up and it gives the perfect amount of peanut taste.  I will definitely repurchase after using it all up.', 'I love this catfood because..it is All natural.

Ghirardhelli works good enough for me. Other than cost, Valrhona is very good! If you can justify the cost it is delicious.\", 'These are a great tasting snack.

Even if I wasn't trying to follow a wheat free diet, I would make these brownies any day!', \"Honestly, it's unfair to review these negatively.Don't buy a feces sandwich if you don't like the taste of poo.That's all I can say.The seller I ordered from sent me a bag of many beans.

We use many herbs in countless ways- even growing and drying out own.  This mix is an excellent quality and intensity of flavor.WHAT IS THIS LIKE?This mix is made of various spices, sea salt, garlic, red pepper, onion, citric acid, and natural lemon juice powder.The acid added to this mix makes it have the perfect pungency.  It accents the herbs beautifully.USESThis jar has various uses listed on the side from salad dressings, to grilling marinades, dry rub, and pasta sauce.We have used it on pasta salad, salad dressing with lemon juice and olive oil as well as balsamic vinegar with olive oil.  We have also used it as a seasoning on eggs, on top of cucumber with a little fresh lemon juice, and with tofu dishes as well.  I also recently used it in a zucchini marinade for grilling- YUM!MY IMPRESSIONS OF THIS MIXMy family loves this mix.  We have been using it constantly since receiving it for just about anything we can think of.The sea salt makes this perfect- I do not use regular salt if at all possible, and the sea salt compliments this perfectly. The garlic is not too much or too little, and the flavor of the herbs is nicely blended.The label says that it makes 8-8oz dressings,and that would be a very heavily herbed flavor.  If you like less flavor, you can do with less if desired.The jar is a nice solid plastic jar with a shake or pour top on it, and it keeps the flavor in nicely.This herb mix was a BIG hit with my family.  It is definitely worth a try- and if you like to use herbs in salad dressings, sauces, and anything that you can get your hands on, be ready- you will go through this quickly!', \"Vanilla pricing fluctuates, but it is pretty low right now. Still, buying a vanilla bean from a gourmet shop will still run you $20+! There is no reason to buy vanilla in a brick-and-mortar store. You can buy literally 50 times the beans for the same price here on Amazon, or through other online retailers who buy more directly from growers.The beans themselves are great.

And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.

More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM.Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage.Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: \"Place powder in a glass or mug,\" it says. \"Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water.\"Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added.

I brew it very strong when hiking (water is precious) by adding a normal amount to an espresso-sized cup.  And it's not half bad!  I even make it at home once in a while by putting it in milk and adding ice to make it nice and cold. Not as good as my Toddy coffee but it works well in a pinch. My only complaint is that it is a bit one-dimensional.  A bit flat and smooth compared a fresh cup of joe.  However it is not unpleasant, and preferable to any other instant I have tried.  It comes sooooo close to the real thing, and I recommend it to anyone in need of instant coffee.', 'I recently found out about these products and I love this breakfast sausages. I have tried the other product: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00304X2BC\">Cedar Lake Tasty Link, 20 Oz. Cans (Case of 12, Vegan)</a>, they both taste good but I like these better. Healthy yet tasty!', \"Whoever created this spice blend did an amazing job because it's a cinnamon, vanilla heaven!I don't like to drink caffeinated teas, but this is worth the exception.It tastes great with vanilla soymilk, too.  So decadent.I will definitely be buying more!  I bought it during the summer because I got a craving for it (it's good any time of year) and it's especially wonderful during the holidays.I steep it for an hour, then reheat it-- not because the tea is weak-- I just do that with all my teas because I like them super strong.\", 'My little one really loves these crackers!  They are lightweight, delicious, and the perfect size for little hands.  My preschooler also loves looking at the letters imprinted on them.', 'If you like a mocha \"shake\", I'd recommend mixing a scoop with chocolate or vanilla protein powder, add a little milk or water with ice cubes, and it's a treat!', \"85% less fat - a bit too good to be true? Couldn't find this on the shelves in Canada.  Been searching for it since first showcased on the Dr.Oz show.  I bought about 10 jars intending to give it to family and friends (especially those who are mindful of their caloric and nutritional intake) as part of their Christmas gifts and am RELIEVED to find it tastes good!  It will be well received by my family and friends.  I have only tried it as a spread and look forward to using it in smoothies.\", 'This is a refreshingly balanced black mint tea that can easily be made much like a usual black tea -- with a usual amount of organic sugar or honey and a usual amount of milk -- as I just did, with an excellent batch of hot black mint tea resulting. So, likely any kind of milk will work well with this rich tea. This is unusual in my experience for many mint teas -- which are many times overwhelmed by such additions. Some typical weaker mint tea variants need delicate handling and are better only iced with only a little sugar or honey and no milk. Yet the mint is very evident and refreshing and is not overwhelmed by additions to this tea. Also this tea does make an execellent iced tea without milk. So this \"Yogi Refreshing Mint Revitalize Tea\" indeed does as claimed by its name +++', 'My show/working dog loves this stuff. It is a great product, healthy, easy to prepare, store, and by the way he eats it.... it must taste good too.', \"These ginger snaps have a great taste and texture. Spicy, not too sweet, crispy.  There is a hint of the funny, gritty texture that most GF baked goods have, but if you didn't know these were GF you wouldn't notice. Will I buy again? Definitely.\", \"If you're a fan of dark chocolate covered cherries you don't need a review. Milk chocolate is easily available during the Holidays, but dark chocolate has to be hunted for. Ordering them thru Amazon is great! I've ordered the last two years.I noticed a change in the individual wrapping this year. They now have a sticker holding the foil closed. I have no complaints with the candies (they're delicious as always!) or with the shipper. The shipper did an excellent job packing them.\", 'I had to lose weight for medical reasons and incorporated Kashi products into most of my meals and snacks. The GOLEAN bars are great! I wish Amazon would sell a wider variety! High in fiber, and low in calories! Not good for diabetics, but good for a meal replacement.', \"I normally drink the donut shop k cup. I've tried pretty much every k cup that can be found in stores. My mom pretty much forced me to check this out and Im glad she did! The taste is strong but not bitter. This has become my go to k cup when I need a coffee pick me up in the morning.\", 'These potato chips are excellent.There are no trans fats.They taste absolutely delicious.Whenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips, Kettles is the brand I buy.A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend them!Enjoy!', \"These chocolates at USD12 for 6 packs is a steal.It's not only cheaper than store prices but it's also more convenient. I don't even have to leave my house to get my hands on my favorite crunch chocolates.\", 'We did a LOT of research before settling on this brand. It is some of the best and highest quality dog food for the price. My wife was concerned that it would not be good for our small dogs (2 pugs), but the pieces are plenty small for them and they both chow down on it.', 'I had never taken raw honey before, but I do find this product to be of very nice quality and the jar easy to handle. Very good would recommend to anyone.', 'This is a GREAT price on k-cups!  My coffee was shipped promptly and arrived quickly!!  I am DEFINITELY going to order again!!', 'This pasta actually tastes like the real thing!  Highly recommended!  I have also had the house foods 20 calorie pasta, but it tastes slimy and only works well with asian style foods.  But this tastes great no matter what and fills you up!  Works well with all sauces, including marinara.  Five stars!!', 'These are the closest thing to Super-Links I have found. The links are smaller in size but taste almost identical.', 'We enjoy spicy foods, and this did not disappoint. They are easy to prepare, and full of flavor. Our 3 kids (ages 9, 7, and 2.5) asked for seconds and thirds! I ordered this on a whim when it was on sale for $7 for the pack of 6. Though the  current $17 price is too expensive for me, I would buy this again if it goes on sale.', 'My cat is a rescued feral who has some gum and intestinal issues left over from his humble beginnings.  He loves the taste of these treats.  Unlike many kinds of cat food and treats, the Greenies do not give him gas or diarrhea.  And his mouth and coat (he is is a meticulous groomer) smell less like a dumpster.  Good for him.  Good for us.', \"We've had to eliminate many snack items for health reasons.Since we've had this popcorn on hand, we've enjoyed it several times a week.Unlike some we've tried, this pops up well every time.You don't end up with two inches of unpopped kernals in the bottom of the bowl.Tastes great and helps to keep us from thinking about some of the less healthy snacks we no longer have on hand.\", 'I've been looking for low calorie snacks to munch on and I'm glad I found these. I've only tried the honey BBQ so far but the flavor is really great. I expected the consistency to be like that of Hot Fries but they are actually really smooth. You get a ton of them in the bag, too. I usually don't like to buy the 100 calorie Oreo packs because half the bag is air and you're still hungry afterwards but that's not the case with these. Full bag, full of flavor, full belly. I'm happy with the price too so I think I\"ll stick with these.', 'Quinoa is a wonderful grain product; I recommend it to all Type 2 diabetics who cannot tolerate rice.  All quinoa is not the same; this particular quinoa is very good quality.', \"I keep trying white teas every chance I get... but this is the one I always come back to and order every month.  It's a very calming tea.  My coworker kids me that it should be a work expense because it helps that much.  It seems much fresher than other teas I've had as well.  As a heads up, silver needle white tea, unlike other types of white tea, seem to had longer steep times.  I can't recommend this tea enough.\", \"With K-Cups being so expensive, I haven't ordered much for a while.  Most prices are over .60 per cup.  That's a lot of money a month for two daily cups of coffee.  Nothing is cheap, and neither are these at about .50 per cup.  I remember the good ol' days when the K-cups were not more than about .35 each, and it wasn't that long ago.I have been buying K-Cups at Costco most recently, and the Tully's they carry are okay.  Newman's Own are just okay too.  Those run .475 per cup, so that's been a little better.  This Martinson coffee comes close to the same price as the ones at Costco, but the flavor is superior.  This is the first cup of coffee I have in the morning. It's got a richer flavor, fresher somehow, than the others I have tried.\", \"I've was introduced to this product several years ago.  They are very good!  I like the fact that you can use yogurt, apple sauce, water etc. to make these brownies.\", 'Enjoy Life Foods sent us four boxes of their new crunchy cookies to taste test. Dr. J now recognizes their label! He wanted to taste test the Double Chocolate first, and of course this chocoholic mommy did not protest!Remember, Enjoy Life Foods products are free of the top 8 food allergens. Could that kind of product make a double chocolate cookie that tastes \"real\"?Um, YES! My mouth waited for the rice aftertaste, but it couldn't find one. Enjoy Life Foods created a chocolate taste on par with homemade, and the crunch satisfied! The boys loved them, as you can see, but I was elated! I confess I hid the rest of the box and saved them for me, though guilt did kick in later and I shared one more with them, ha!Now, it would have been very easy to gorge ourselves and eat all four boxes at once, but I needed to test these cookies on a non gluten- and dairy-free eater...Daddy! The next night we had another taste test, this time trying two cookies: Chocolate Chip and Vanilla Honey Graham. Again the boys loved them! And Daddy? My pickiest taste tester of all things allergy-friendly? What was his verdict?Good! He preferred the chocolate chip, but said the Vanilla Honey Graham was decent. There's an ever-so-slight after taste to the graham cookies, but Meatball didn't seem to mind!If you've been counting, there is one more flavor left--Sugar Crisp. Now, I grew up with a Type 1 diabetic mom. The sugar cookies she made were reduced sugar, and I loved them. Most other sugar cookies were always too sweet for me. I figured this would be the case as well, and Daddy and Meatball would get the bulk of the sugar cookies.Wrong! When I bit into my first Sugar Crisp, I was amazed. There was a buttery flavor to it. I grabbed the box--was there some mistake? Was dairy hidden there and somehow Enjoy Life Foods missed it, marketed it wrong? What were the ingredients? How did they get that flavor?I don't know! But there's still no dairy in there! The Sugar Crisp had just the right sweetness, and of course the same satisfying crunch. I ate a lot of them. At first Dr. J didn't want them because they looked a whole lot like another sugar cookie he had tried and not liked. I asked him to please try a bite, and of course he didn't like them. However, after two days of watching Mommy and Meatball eat them, he finally gave them another taste, and was quite happy to consume some himself!I think we can happily say Enjoy Life Foods Crunchy Cookies will definitely be a back up plan for when Mommy forgot to make cookies and we need to take a treat somewhere. My flavor preferences in order were: Double Chocolate, Chocolate Chip and Sugar Crisp tied (seriously, who would have thought!), and finally the Vanilla Honey Graham. Some of you will be able to find them in your local allergy-friendly grocery stores now, and some of you will need to be watching (and ASKING) for them as Enjoy Life Foods continues to get them into the market. You all have my permission to eat two Double Chocolate cookies when you get them--one for you, and one for me!Enjoy Life Foods sent us their Crunchy Cookies for taste testing and honest review. All opinions, and cookie crumbs in the keyboard, are my own. You can learn more about these cookies and their other new products here at their website. I also want to thank them for donating crunchy cookies to our Southeast Michigan Spectrum Moms family picnic in May.', 'Over the last two years, our older cat (now 11 years old) had ongoing issues with diarrhea and vomiting.  After several trips to the vet and numerous tests that found nothing wrong, we were left thinking that this was her lot in life, sensitive to hairballs with a testy stomach.  We changed her to a vet-recommended food and went on with life, but as you can imagine, she was still suffering.She was dehydrated, her coat was rough, she was losing muscle and constantly hungry because she was essentially living life as a non-voluntary bulimic.  At one point, I hoped a test for her thyroid would be positive so we could just figure out what on earth was wrong with her.Last month I decided I didn't have anything else to lose so I started researching holistic treatments for her various symptoms.  I happened upon a description of grain allergies in cats and I was astounded at the number of symptoms she had.  Her eyes were always watery, her lips and gums a little swollen, and these were things her vet and I had attributed to \"getting older\" or her \"hairball sensitivity\" since none of the test had pinpointed a problem.After some research to select a quality brand, I ordered Wellness Core Dry and Wet food.  I didn't bother to transition her, just started her on it right away.  Besides, she wasn't keeping down much of the other food anyway.  She took to it right away, and she's a picky one.Within two days, the diarrhea was gone.  Within a week, she brought up a hairball that would shame a lesser cat.  It's been a month now and the only bad thing I can say is that I wish I'd found this food sooner.  No more watery eyes, no more swollen lips, and no more noxious fumes from the litter box.  My husband and I cannot believe that fact, but it is true.  A high-quality food WILL reduce litter box odor.  I didn't believe it until I...well...didn't smell it.I'm transitioning our other cat to it now and he already looks better for it.  The food has a stronger odor than store-brand cat food.  You'll also want to note that it doesn't have preservatives, so it's bound to have a stronger smell.  The wet food actually smells good, for cat food.  We use the Wellness Core 3oz Grain-Free Chicken.  I'm sure our experiences will vary, but I've watched a cat who was the epitome of finicky, who would turn her nose up at Fancy Feast if the same flavors were served back to back, gobble the same flavor everyday for the last 30 days without complaint, and most notably, without vomit.  So I'd say she gives her claw of approval.Bottom line?  It's pricy, sure.  But it's worth it for us.  Considering the money we're saving in paper towel clean up expenses alone, we're probably saving a buck or two.  I should also thank Amazon for making it Prime eligible, so it's easier to buy it here than to find it in the store.  So now, instead of begging me to feed them, our cats can start mauling the UPS man.', \"These have a lot of flavor in them, will satisfy that craving for something crunchy, and are a great alternative to other snack foods that are full of fat and MSG.  I'll use them like croutons in a salad or just grab a handful for a quick snack.\", 'I order these to make \"Artichoke Bottoms\" appetizer. I have ordered them to be delivered across the country for family gatherings so I don't have to worry if I can find them locally.4 cans Artichoke bottoms - rinse and dry3 cups grated fresh parmesan cheese - or buy shredded in deli1 cup mayo6 cloves garlic - finely minced4 teaspoons FRESH lemon juice4 teaspoons lemon zest1/2 cup pine nuts - coarsely choppedPut bottoms in cookie sheet with sides - make sure they lie flat, may have to slice a little off bottoms. Combine Parmesan cheese, mayo, garlic, lemon juice and lemon zest. Mound mixture into bottoms. Sprinkle with pine nuts. Bake 20 or so min at 350. If bottoms are large, you can cut into halves or forths for easier eating by guests. Tip: you can fix the bottoms, make the mixture, fill the bottoms before guests arrive. Sprinkle with nuts and bake. Very rich, very good, easy to make...M.C.', 'I love this K-Cup. I like the \"non-burnt\" tasting, light coffee and this one does that. It's so smooth you can actually pick up other, non-coffee flavors.The only negative it is so tasty, you'll just want to keep making cups of it and drink it all day.', '*****Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea has a fragrant bouquet, and an unusual taste that comes from the blend of red tea and white tea. The red tea taste is more dominant, the white tea taste subtle. I have to say that I like the red and white blend more than the red alone. I still probably prefer white tea more, but this blend is lovely, and lower in caffeine (the red tea has no caffeine, the white tea a bit). This tea contains only South African rooibos (another word for red tea) and white tea.The package says that it contains a hint of sweetness, and I'd agree, although the taste is very hard to describe (if you've had red tea before then you understand). The package also says that this tea is full of \"potent antioxidants\", which of course is very healthy.I would highly recommend Stash's Fusion Red & White Tea unless you do not care for rooibos or white tea; otherwise you will enjoy this.Recommended.*****', \"What can I say!  I grew up with this candy. Especially during the holidays we had fresh fruit on the table and always Ferrara's Italian Torrone!  Tradition in our house.  I'm Italian but you don't have to be Italian to enjoy it!  I make up Italian cookie trays for the holidays and always add the Torroneto the tray, it looks so pretty in their little boxes.  Try it you'll love it!\", 'I loveo this milko =o) I buy it at my college cafe when I have a long day of classes, and this is really tasty and gives me energy to get through my long, boring day! Its not thick at all like regular milk and not too choclatey like Nesquik, and its healthy for everyone. I got my mom slowly hooked on Silk milk, the regular flavored one so she buys that now along with cow milk but hopefully I will bring her fully over to the \"dark side\" :)', 'I have waited paitently for several years now to be able to enjoy oatmeal again.  I have purchased the steel oats in the past, but they just take too long to make for breakfasts, and I really did not like the taste or texture of them.This instant oatmeal is delicious, and I can add my own fruit or flavorings, quick to make up before work in the mornings, and very satisfying.  Thank you.', \"I have been using these smoker bags for several years. the first time I used them I bought them from my local Cub foods grocery store. i however now just order them on line since I can get them year around. I have used them on the grill, but mostly inside in the oven. I use them mainly for smoking ribs and turkey legs. They always come out perfect. Everyone compliments me on the flavor and tenderness of the meat. I usually finish them up on the gas grill with barbeque sauce for that perfct taste. I have given these away to friends nd family and they are now using them. I would be really surprised if anyone tried them and didn't like them.UPDATEI used a smoker bag to make incredible pulled pork. I used a 6 lb pork shoulder and seasoned it. Placed in the smoker bag at 225. I put mine in the oven at midnight and let it slow roast till 7 am. I was afraid at this low heat it would not get smokey enough but it was perfect. I pulled the pork apart in the juices from the bag and it was as good as any pulled pork I've had.\", 'A can of tasty small fish in tomato sauce, which offsets the fishy taste and smell quite a bit.  What was really a surprise to me is how good they tasted when I warmed them up in the microwave for just about ten seconds to take the chill off.Try these tasty little tomato sauce sardines to add some variety to your sardine diet.', \"This is definitely one of my favorites it has a fresh and great coffee taste, it's delicious. This will definitely be a must buy for those that like strong (almost espresso) coffee. If you need some energy and a nice strong kick in the morning this is definitely the coffee for you. I know I do, I live in NYC and have an awful commute in the morning. So, I need lots of caffeine to get through my commute and the rest of the day. I wasn't really getting that from some of my other coffee choices of the k-cups. I just got my machine and I am experimenting with all the extra and extra-extra bold coffees and so far between this one and the Timothy's Parisian Nights. So, so good I love them!! This is very addicting, strong coffee!!! ;o)\", \"I was sure that there was never a chip that I loved enough to give it 5 stars. But while traveling I bought a bag of these chips ($3.97 I might add) at a natural market type store and just loved them (other than the price).The chips themselves don't have a high oil or greasy taste that some enjoy, but the selection of spices and herbs that Garden of Eatin' has developed is just GREAT.I have bought three cases so far and just love them!\", 'This is a great alternative to peanut butter. Great taste without the fat or calories.  This should be in every heath conscious pantry. a great travel food as well.  Can be easily reconstituted on an airplane, or in the office during a busy day.', 'I have five cats so getting all of them to like a food can be difficult. I give them wetfood as a weekly treat and this is the only type they all love and devour! They all love the gravy and two in particular mostly just lick the gravy so this is more food for my buck!', 'Great quality at a good price and pure yumminess!!! I ate them! It felt like eating a jar of healthy goodness.Thanks!', 'I make iced tea with this.  It is very tasty, like their bottled teas, but at a fraction of the cost.', 'I am committed to getting unfermented soy products out of my diet.  I find that most chocolate candies use soy lecithin as an emulsifier.  After finding out that soy lecithin is pretty much the sludge that is left over after chemicals like hexane are used to extract the oil from soybeans, I decided that I want nothing to do with it.  (In the days before corn and soy crops were subsidized by the government, we got lecithin from eggs, not soy sludge.)  Enjoy Life chips are soy free and they taste great.  I use them to make my own mint truffles.']\n"

      "[\"I ordered this for my 17 year old cat. She only has one tooth and is very finicky. She will only eat the seafood pate of Friskies. I thought the purchase was a great deal since it was cheaper than Walmart and I could have it delivered to my house for a free price. I thought this was a good idea.<br />Well, I was wrong.<br />My housemate and I wondered what that godawful smell was. After weeks of dealing with cockroaches scurrying under furniture and fruit flies perching everywhere, I found out where they were breeding. One of the cans arrived banged up and maggots decided to call it home. You think fresh cat food smells bad?<br />I brought home a premature infant and was afraid of all of the germs that infested the place at the time. I did not want a single risk posed to him getting sick. So I kept him in his room until I found out where the funk was coming from.<br />The moral of this story is unless you don't mind infestation and possible contamination, don't order cat food online.\", 'I put this in an area in the yard as suggested on the directions.  My dogs both went over to investigate immediately. Sniffed it and have never gone back!<br /><br />My dogs are 2 and 3, so maybe it would work with a puppy.', \"Just did not like Pamela's Oat Blueberry Lemon bars that much.  They did not have much taste.  I think<br />they could have had more nuts.  Another reason was I do not care for blueberries that much.\", \"We've tried these bars several times in a few different flavors and they are always cross contaminated with dairy.  I think the chocolate actually contains milk so that may be the source of the problem. My kid's allergic so it's pretty easy to tell when a new food is causing a problem.<br /><br />They're delicious and the times we've tried them they are never stale or too hard to chew (like the other natural crispy rice bar that is actually dairy free).  Wish they didn't have a cross contamination problem.\", 'We found live black small insects crawling inside several of the unopened McCanns packs that I purchased from Amazon. I reported this to both Amazon and to McCanns customer service dept. Some called me from McCanns, apologized and sent an empty pre-paid carton to ship the item back to them for further analysis. She said that they would replace the item but never did. However, Amazon refunded my purchase amount. I threw away the packs that had live black insects in them. A total of four boxes. So, beware of live insects and look carefully before opening the packets if you buy these.', 'DO NOT BUY THIS K CUP - IT IS INSTANT COFFEE CRYSTALS IN THE CUP.<br />TASTES AWFUL.<br />VERY MISLEADING.', 'I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it\\'s organic. Real \"premium\" dog foods brag that they\\'ve no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real \"premium\" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it\\'s not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it\\'s cheap, but it\\'s not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real \"premium\" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don\\'t be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company\\'s 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!', \"This is not worth it.  My pit ate it in large chunks in under a minute.  i bought it locally for what i'd pay for dinner- not worth it in terms of money or time in keeping him busy.  he takes longer to eat an entire bowl of food..\", \"When I purchaed this item, I thought it will be normal size lollipop...

The company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients.<br /><br />Let me start my review stating that many of the current 5-star ratings here look suspiciously fake (made up). Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food.', \"My biggest problem with Amazon is their return policy, or lack thereof, on unopened grocery items. I ordered the four pack since they can't seem to sell single boxes, and ended up hating this stuff. Now I'm stuck with three new boxes of inedible oatmeal. I couldn't get passed the  artificial sweetener aftertaste.\", \"I tried these despite the negative reviews hoping they were wrong.  They weren't!!  Only at the very end of the cup of coffee did I detect a tiny hint of the cinnamon.  I do not know why or quite frankly how, the company ever named it cinnamon roll.\", \"These noodles just arrived yesterday and I now know the secret of their weight loss properties: they will have you throwing up all night. I ate some of these for dinner last night and though I didn't really like them I thought I could at least tolerate them but I started feeling very full after I'd eaten a small ammount (which I thought was a good thing at the time) and ended up waking up at 2am this morning with intense stomach pain, nausea and vomiting. I have never had stomach pain this intense in my life and I have a very strong stomach so this was a horrible shock. I would NEVER buy or reccomend this to anyone ever.\", 'I sent this cake to my daughter who goes to college in Florida. It was sent for her birthday which I indicated on the message site for this product. I was really happy that it actually arrived on her birthday. Unfortunately, \"Happy Birthday\" wasn\\'t on the cake ( not a big deal), but the icing had begun sliding off,too. Ok, Miami is hot and even with good packaging things don\\'t always go right. What was really annoying was that the cake was so bad it had to be thrown away. My daughter couldn\\'t even finish the first slice she had taken. I understand that store bought cakes never taste as good as a homemade cake made from scratch, but this one wasn\\'t even edible at all ?! That\\'s just not acceptable, and I would not recommend this cake at all.', 'When I tasted it, I thought i must have bought diet by mistake.  Nope -- too sweet and disgusting aftertaste made me read the ingredients.  Even though it has normal sweeteners, it also has diet ones.  Ew.', 'I had such high hopes for this apple cider but it was a huge disappointment...terribly sweet and an awful artificial flavor.', \"I didn't realize each would be individually wrapped or I wouldn't have bought it, too much waste and too much mess spills when you open. I also don't taste dark chocolate, and it says milk right on the ingredients, so I think they're full of it. I have to eat over the garbage can because everything spills, then wash my hands because the incredibly thin layer of milk chocolate melts immediately. Refrigerated, it's not nearly as bad, but that's silly for a simple snack.<br /><br />As a single, it's entirely unsatisfying. It's so small that it's almost inert, it does nothing to stave off hunger or bring back alertness. They should have packed two to a pack, that would at least put a dent in it, while still being at comparable to all of their other bars; buy one of them instead. Just assume you'll need two at a time. Hey, there's such a thing as too few calories.<br /><br />What amazes me is that the label contains four different sugars: One sucrose, and three different ways of saying maltodextrin. Obviously NV believes consumers are stupid and will gladly try to hide the actual level of sugars (it would be the first ingredient if all four were added together).<br /><br />Note that they've just started selling boxes of 48 instead of 36 in stores, so Amazon might get them soon.\", 'The quality of the tea in this blend is probably fine.  However, the lavender is so overbearing that one can taste nothing else.<br /><br />To be fair, the product description did contain the word lavender.  Perhaps a few lavender buds would be amusing, but this blend is over the top, de trop.', \"Unfortunately, this product contains milk. There was no description (except vegetarian), i.e., no ingredients listed. The local version of this product does not contain milk, although it looks exactly the same. I cannot eat the chocolate with milk, and hence am out $40. Nutricity refused any sort of refund or credit and just gave a corporate boilerplate get-lost type response. Also, they refused to change the description of the product for future buyers to indicate the ingredients. If you don't mind milk in your dark chocolate, you might like this product, but I'd advise against buying anything from Nutricity.\", 'I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.

I read that Dogswell was going to stop manufacturing in China tho dont know current status.', \"A watered down perversion of the acai berry.<br /><br />This juice comes on strong and harsh.  With tart aftertaste and no texture.<br /><br />That's because it is mostly apple juice, grape juice, pomegranate juice, blackberry juice, blueberry juice, and tart cherry juice.  Oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoction.<br /><br />You shall not find that distinctive  smooth chocolaty acai flavor here.  There is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither.  For that exotic unique acai experience try Zola or Samzon  brands.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this Lakewood juice product isn't nutritious.  That's not my point.  I'm saying that it's a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice.\", 'These sugar decorations look very similar to the picture, except, the surface is very rough, like an emery board, porous and this makes the color look very faded.

And I always thought Celestial Seasonings was top notch!  Beware!!', \"I bought this for our Christmas dinner. BIG mistake. What we received was a very small, and extremely overpriced turkey stuffed with little pieces of what may have been duck and/or chicken... and a lot of nasty-tasting stuffing. The proportions were NOTHING like what is pictured.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to the nature of the product (frozen, stuffed) and the time it is traditionally served (Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner) you don't find out it is crap until it comes out of the oven... and by then you are stuck with it, because most of the stores are already closed.<br /><br />Despite the small amount of meat, it easily fed seven people, with ample left-overs... mainly because nobody finished what was on their plates, let alone went back for seconds.<br /><br />On a positive note, our dog loved the stuff and happily ate everything that was dumped into her bowl.\", 'ogs would not touch this dog food..

I didnt see it when i bought, perhaps a greater or a warning at all would help', 'I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like \"Beneful\" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We\\'re talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can\\'t believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.', 'There was only one bad review, so I decided to ignore it because most of the reviews were favorable.

The only explanation I arrive at is they\\'ve never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.<br />I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) \"new look, same great taste\" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.

The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it \"Icky Stik\" or \"Stinky Stik\" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.<br /><br />We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you\\'ll play heck trying to wash it off.<br /><br />A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of \"Braised Liver\" or \"Smoky Bacon\"?

But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he\\'s consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it\\'s red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn\\'t been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn\\'t know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they\\'re having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we\\'ve been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the \"customer service representative\" if you can call her that, simply said \"if you don\\'t like it then don\\'t buy it.\" And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it\\'s appearance nor did they add any \"stickers\" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn\\'t affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I\\'m sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it.', 'Beef Jerky has always been one of my favorite snacking foods.  I even used to make my own when I was younger.  I\\'ve tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride.  It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.<br /><br />Kickin\\' Teriyaki is the flavor I got.  To be sure I didn\\'t just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless.  I do not taste anything \"kickin\" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either.  To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG).  Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.<br /><br />On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them.  Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn\\'t tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.<br /><br />OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery.  While it doesn\\'t contain \"added\" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient.  I\\'ve never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life.  So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided', \"Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.<br /><br />Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.<br /><br />The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.  She seems fine today, but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae, I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well.\", 'About 40% packets had no sugar in them and a bunch others were open and leaking.

The product is not returnable hence a total waste of the $30, since our aim was to have received a fresh tasting and looking batch of sugar in packets to serve to our clients.

They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again.

As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials.

This bag of basmati rice was packaged well, packed well for shipping, and shipped promptly.  But the rice itself is very disappointing.  It's instant rice, and not very good instant rice at that, with a basmati flavor.  It cooks in ten minutes to a mushy pasty individual grain.<br />  What with having ten pounds of it, I've tried cooking it every way that rice can be cooked, just in case I was preparing it incorrectly. Nope, tastes like someone made rice mush and then extruded it thru small holes and re-dried it. My family and I enjoy whole grain rices that generally take 55 minutes to cook and allow you to have a pleasant flavor and distinct individual grain texture to the mouth. I even tried using it as a filler for meat loaf or meat balls.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', 'This was a Mother\\'s day gift which arrived completely melted.

In fact, Twinnings is my favorite brand of hot tea - and I drink hot tea several times a day - so I am guessing I must not like Oolong tea.  I had high hopes for this Oolong tea - the description on the box was most inviting.<br /><br />My first hurdle in trying to drink this tea (after steeping a few minutes in my tea cup) was the smell.  Oh, and what a smell it is - like freshly turned earth with a sour note - difficult to describe, but nauseating nonetheless.  And if I thought the smell was bad, the taste was even worse (and I didn't think that was possible).  Oh, how to describe - like muddy water with sharp grassy notes - at least to me.  My husband laughed when he saw me sip this the first time - he said the look on my face was the same expression I had when I would change our son's diaper after he left a particularly large gift to clean up.<br /><br />So, I think I will just stick with my beloved Irish Breakfast, Earl Grey, Lady Grey, and English afternoon teas by Twinnings.

I do however have a HUGE problem with stray hairs in my loose tea.  The first time I scooped some out and noticed a long hair (and not the color of mine) in with the tea I was grossed out but thought \"Hey it happens\".  The second time I found another hair down further in the bag (oddly enough a different color and longer) it completely repulsed me.<br /><br />This isn\\'t bad tea, but I would say there\\'s a quality control problem in filling the bags.

She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.<br /><br />Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.<br /><br />I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />\"Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.\"<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />\"We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.\"<br /><br />After talking with my dog\\'s breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders\\' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The \"Canidae Team\" didn\\'t mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.<br /><br />So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.<br /><br />I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn\\'t address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?', \"This jam is really good, but serioulsy, the price is just not right.

I posted this review for the \"Natural Light\" variety, and it was originally on that page.  Now that the \"Natural Light\" was discontinued, they moved my review to this version where it doesn\\'t apply.  However it is still true that the company which purchased Orville Redenbacher, ConAgra, no longer is making a less salty, 3.5oz/bag popcorn with unrefined palm oil.  This is a shame as no one else is either.  Despite what amazon.com has been doing, this is not an acceptable substitute for the other product and shouldn\\'t be sent without permission to people who had the \"Natural Light\" on subscription delivery.  And after over a year of complaints, the bag size in the description should have been corrected.  Amazon.com, this is really shoddy behavior, and leads me to think it is a matter of mega-companies sticking together to scam customers out of our hard-earned cash.<br /><br />This review has been edited to reflect the mfr.\\'s change of the product.<br /><br />When I first reviewed this popcorn, I was describing the popcorn as it was in 2006.  It was made w/ very healthy unrefined palm oil containing nutritious beta-carotene and no trans fats.  It was also 3.5oz per bag.<br /><br />The mfr. has degraded the product.  It\\'s now made w/ partially hydrogenated soy oil that has trans fat, and they\\'ve shrunk the bag to 2.9oz..  It\\'s not any healthier or tastier than econo-brands now, but it is still much more expensive.  You also have to cook it for less time than is printed on the bag b/c of the smaller amount or it will burn.<br /><br />Whenever a good product is cheapened like this I always do an online search to see if the company was acquired, and sure enough, ConAgra bought Orville Redenbacher.  If you scan the reviews you\\'ll see that almost all the 5-star reviews were written before 2007.  So don\\'t bother complaining to the company about the decline in quality, b/c they don\\'t care.', 'The description of this item said \"2-Count\" so I expected it to have two bones.

I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!\", \"Even though this appears to be intended for dogs, I bought this for my cat Digby.

This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it.

And at 4.99 per bottle, that's an expensive mistake to make, food-wise.  My advice is just to skip it!  Get the nonsweetened nonsalted peanut butter instead and have that with jam.

Recently someone gave me the Mocha flavored Via to try, apparently because they could not stand the taste after one sip.  Well I thought perhaps they were just too haughty, and I offered to take the rest.  I finally tried one last night, and now I know why it was given away by the previous taster.<br /><br />The Mocha flavored Via is disgusting.  Rather than having any flavor of chocolate at all, it has a strong artificial sweetener taste - as if someone dumped in a package of saccharine and called it cocoa.

These noodles have the most unbearable smell, and no amount of rinsing and microwaving I did could remove the horrendous stench.  Additionally, they were so oddly chewy and gelatinous that it is difficult to eat them.  You kind of have to knaw on them to get them to break off into bites.

This time however, upon arrival it was not same company, packaging or label (hokey looking)... Instead of \"Frontier\" it said \"Organic Herbal Essence\".  Upon further investigation I went to my Amazon history and noticed first batch came from Sold by: Bangalla Organic Wholesale LLC and second batch came from Sold by: Organic Herbal Essence.  Keep in mind that Organic Herbal Essence is the cocoa that sells on Amazon that is only rated at 2-stars:[...]  I checked and can\\'t return it. Called Organic Hebal Essence during business hours, left message, no one returned my call.  My opinion is just slapping a tiny white Avery label on the bag with tiny print (really tiny) that says \"Frontier Cocoa\" doesn\\'t eliminate the huge color label on the bag that says \"Organic Herbal Essence... Dutch Cocoa\".  it certainly doesn\\'t turn a 2-star cocoa into a 4 1/2 star cocoa.

This masala chai has a strongly imbalanced flavor; these same spices mixed with more black assam tea would produce a strong tea beverage, not bitter (steeping tea extra long releases bitter tanins, not more tea flavor), with a very pleasant flavor from the spices.  As-is, it is a failure.<br /><br />Since this costs as much as Irish Breakfast Tea bags, and I assume that the spices aren't free, it is my deduction that tea quantity is significantly lower in this particular blend.  Notably, if you were to use loose tea of the same composition, you would use more of it; although I imagine then the spice blend would be overpowering.  The best course would be to use loose Chai tea of the normal blend, and use more total quantity to raise both the tea and spice concentration together; or, for more spice, you would use an in-between blend, but again greater total quantity.<br /><br />This Chai tea is overbalanced towards spice; the total volume is too low for a proper balance.\", \"I have never reviewed an item before, but taking the time to review the Baby Brezza because of the unfortunate experiences I have had with this product and to warn people not to spend $100 on such a poorly made product.. I read multiple reviews on the Baby Brezza and read some negative reviews about the blade not working. But I tend to go with positive reviews if they outweigh the negative ones, but from now on, I will definitely reconsider buying anything with negative reviews, and the Baby Brezza purchase has actually discouraged me from buying anything from Amazon that is expensive and can be broken, as you cannot return the product after 30 days.<br /><br />I bought the BB in February 2012 and should have returned it right away after I had some problems from the beginning, but I was too excited to use it so I did not.<br /><br />1. The cover never fit quite right. The manual said that the blade has two positions, up for steaming and down for blending, and obviously up if you are going to steam/blend but it did not seem like the blade had 2 positions and I always had to readjust the cover to make it fit, turning the blade slightly down from the up position so the cover would close and lock.<br /><br />2. I bought the grain basket accesory and it never fit! The cover just would not close, it was much too tall! That should have been the final indication that I had a defective BB but it was so much trouble to return the product to Customer Service and I just played phonetag with them!<br /><br />I was still able to use it for the purposes I wanted, to steam and blend fruits and veggies so I just kept using it for a while til the final third thing happened!<br /><br />3. The whole thing just broke! The driveshaft and blade just popped off one time! Blade just would not turn!<br /><br />Called customer service. Terrible experince except for one rep that was really nice whom I had been playing phonetag with. Before I talked to the rep I really liked, the two I spoke with including the manager were rude and unhelpful. Granted, I called when I was upset and was probably mean myself but I thought customer service people's job is to make the customer happy, which I learned at 14 years old at my first job at a restaurant. They argued with me, displayed frustration even mild anger with their voice as well as impatience when I asked if I can get a full refund. They said I would have to return the product and wait for it to be inspected, and maybe I will get a refund. They also said that I could not get a refund on the grain basket as they do not give refunds for accesories and the first rep even argued with me asking if I had left the blade in when I put in the grain basket, which is impossible to do if you wanted to put in the grain basket at the same time.<br /><br />So I asked to speak with the rep I had been playing phonetag with, and she was really nice, patient, and tried to keep her customer happy. She offered to send a new Baby Brezza without me sending in the broken one, a new grain basket that she said she would make sure it fit, and another free accesory of my choice. The new BB along with the other two products came quickly, few days and so I was a happy customer again!<br /><br />The new one I received is different from the one I originally bought. The blade was a different color, more brown instead of orange, the driveshaft lock at the bottom of the pitcher was configured diffrently, and the blade had 2 definite positions, up and down, the cover fit perfect, and the grain basket fit. But guess what!<br /><br />4. This time the blade was broken. It still works but the top part that twists comes off, which I didnt think was a big deal as it still worked but when I was cleaning it, the bottom with the blade part fell off and almost hit my dog! I checked the old BB i had and the top of the blade did not come off so...<br /><br />I called the nice rep again. She sent me a new pitcher, driveshaft, and blade. She didn't send me any new accessories for my trouble when I asked, but she was still very nice. I did tell her that this new BB is a lot better than my first one and she said the one I have is from a different line, so their product is not even standard!<br /><br />5. Got it the mail today, the top of the blade still came off! I left a message with the nice rep again but this is now ridiculous. My baby is one year old and I donT even use it as much anymore!<br /><br />So hence, why I am writing this review. Save your money and trouble and get a steamer and a handheld blender to make babyfood. Oh, I used the grain basket to make small sized pasta like it suggests, not big size pasta. It came out like paste, all stuck together!  And I made same pasta in a saucepan in 5 mins and it was fine. Grain basket took 25 mins and pasta was one solid, pasty mess when it was done! So just boil pasta in a saucepan.<br /><br />Originally gave  it two stars for the nice rep but changing it to one star. If it was not so cheap and a poorly made product with all the malfunctions, I would have been happy with it. Should have gotten the Beaba fron William and Sonoma, maybe they at least would take back a broken product without me packing it in a box, going to usps, spending money, to get my $100 back! Or they should only charge $40 for the BB, not $100 or have the accesories go with it for free! I guess that is what you may get with products made in China.<br /><br />Addendum: my husband just told me that he noticed there is water leaking in the back when it is on steam mode, when the first one did not do that. It seems like the second BB we have has a new set of problems. When I decided to buy the Brezza earlier this year (2012) there were only a few one star reviews compaining it did not work. I just read the current ones and there are so many one star reviews complaining of the same defects I experienced or different ones that really scare me like oil leaking that I donot want to use this product anymore. I would not have bought it if  I was reading the same reviews back when I decided to buy it. I am goIng to call Amazon to see if they can issue me the refund. It is near impossible to get a live person on the Brezza customer service and they do call back, but it takes a while and it is so incovenient. And with a product like this that you use a lot for only a limited amount of time when baby eats babyfood, it is really a rip off to not just send someone a replacement right away. Planning to call Amazon to see if they can take a look of how many complaints there are of this defective product and not sell this product anymore. It is a disservice to loyal customers of amazon. Makes me want to stick to brick and mortar stores so you don't have the inconvenience and frustration of not getting a refund or a replacement immediately. Maybe for some people, $100 is nothing but for us, $100 was an investment of a product I was planning to use well into my baby's toddler years to sneak in pureed vegetables in their spaghetti sauce like the BB site advertises.

Sea salt made a bite of it almost edible--yknow, thick salty broth--and adding a touch of herbs just ruined the herbs.<br /><br />The reason it can\\'t be salvaged? Their chicken is repulsive. I\\'m almost sure they boiled the bird, and that is only acceptable for broth where the bird gets removed. In fact, I have a hunch--especially given the whole thing possessed ONE tiny flaky pea sized square of meat--they got \"responsible\" and took the bird etc used for the broth--the broth strained out and packaged--and just blended that boiled limp weird-odor meat and such and tossed in some rice flour and dairy to try passing it for soup.<br /><br />Ever made your own broth, the kind where you boil it til the bird is almost Michael Jackson white because you aren\\'t going to use it as part of the dish and want to yank all its flavor out? You know how funky boiled, denatured bird smells and tastes? This is that bird. Now I have finally figured out why baby food is so repulsive, a mystery I was content to never even ponder. I hate that I am dumping the remaining 90% of this out, but I\\'ll be tasting it coming back up if I don\\'t (4 tiny spoonfuls and it already has me belchy and nauseous!).

I have to say that I was one of the unfortunate few folks who experienced side effects so dramatic (extreme heart rhythm interruption, loss of vision, numbness in the arms and hands, etc.) that I will never try one of these drinks ever again.  The impacts to my heart (I typically have great blood pressure and heart rate from years of exercise and road bike racing/riding) were so over the top that I had no patterned rhythm and I ended up in the emergency room after passing out from a huge drop in blood pressure.  My vision became blurry and eventually tunneled, and the EMT squad who responded to the 911 call (we initially thought I was having a heart attack) could not get any regular heart beat for about 15 minutes (and this took four baby aspirin and a nitro pill).<br /><br />Interestingly enough, other members of our group who also tried the 5 hour energy drink experienced a nice rush of energy and felt great, others in the group basically stated that the mixture tasted like dirty water and had absolutely no effect whatsoever.  I guess this basically tells me that the ingredients (at least for this brand of energy drink supplement) really react differently for everyone.  I did notice that the drink provides a warning about not consuming more than two in a specific period of time.

This product is widely used in Thai restaurants where the cooks don't want to cook, and don't want to invest the time in training workers who change restaurants every 6 months...they just want to hire untrained laborers who can open cans and scoop pre-made mixes out of containers.  It takes a bit of time and practice to make curry paste, but do it a few and you can master the art of working with the spices.

After reading a few other reviews on the strange packaging, I was almost afraid to open it - who knows what I would find. My daughter had a strong chocolate urge so we pulled off the wrappers.<br /><br />Oh my gosh, it is hard to know what to say. What was this company thinking?<br /><br />Let's start with the packaging. At first glance the basket looks simple yet classy and attractive and boasting what appears to be an assortment of delectable chocolates. That illusion is lost once you have opened the package. There are paper wrappings around boxes with the product name. But the actual boxes are for common grocery items like jello, fruit loops, flan etc. Can you imagine diving into a box of truffles that say Kenzi on the surface only to find the box below is for jello? A box of jello whose expiration was several years ago. How long does one keep old cereal boxes around, but more importantly, why would you package gift basket chocolate in old jello and cereal boxes?<br /><br />One of the boxes has a computer generated label that has been cheaply made and taped to it.<br /><br />So what is in the box? Well in one I pulled out a bag of peanuts that had melted and then solidified in one chunk. In another were small brown things that I believe were supposed to be truffles. There were also some wrapped cheap chocolate such as a chocolate graham cracker.<br /><br />The entire basket was unappetizing and unappealing. I can't share how the chocolate tastes, because after pulling it out of jello and flan boxes and seeing the melted condition, there was no way I was eating it despite my love for chocolate.<br /><br />With proper packaging and shipping, there would be a much better result but as it is now, it should not be for sale.<br /><br />This is definitely not a gift basket you will want to give.\", \"The description on this item does not specify that this is the LOW SODIUM Homestyle Chicken Noodle, though the  picture does say so if you look closely.  Sadly, Campbell's appears to have discontinued the regular Homestyle chicken noodle (I cannot find it in any grocery stores, or online) and only offers the healthy request and low sodium options.  The low sodium is AWFUL!!  The flavor is completely flat and almost tasteless, and adding salt does not improve it.<br /><br />I can understand offering healthier options for parents and others who need to avoid sodium, but I'm ticked off that Campbell's has taken away the regular flavor.  I will say that the price here is reasonable - Campbell's soups are approaching $2 a can in many supermarkets - especially if you subscribe.  I would happily subscribe if this were the regular Homestyle.  As it is, I can't recommend this flavorless soup.  I'd rather make my own.\", \"I don't think I have ever given 1 star to any product but this one deserves it. I am a weak coffee drinker and this taste like water.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', \"This is my very first review - I thought these were genuinely terrible.

They were in no way up to the standards of the ones I had before. From now on, if I want a chocolate turtle, I'll go to a candy store and get them fresh.

Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what\\'s happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?

I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don\\'t drink coffee, but I\\'m just giving that as an example).  Even with the \"discounts\" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they\\'re still overpriced.<br /><br />Now, I\\'ll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:<br /><br />By the time I\\'d gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I\\'m also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it\\'s difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.<br /><br />So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />Awful taste that doesn\\'t go away<br />Grossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers have<br />Doesn\\'t actually give you energy<br />Possible elevated heart rate upon consumption<br />Jitters<br />Inability to concentrate<br />Might make you irritable<br />May cause stomachaches<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />If you\\'re tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.<br /><br />Simply put (if you don\\'t feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I\\'ve ever purchased in my life.  And I\\'ve bought a lot of junk.  Don\\'t buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.

This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients).  Here is what the FDA says on its web site:<br /><br />\"It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a \"stew,\" \"in sauce,\" \"in gravy,\" or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn\\'t sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter).\"<br /><br />On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA\\'s). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can).  The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients.  Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight.  Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight.  So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet.<br /><br />So if you have a lot of money to waste and don\\'t mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva.

Each of my dropped jade leaves had a small brown spot at the base where thrips had been feeding. The real danger from thrips is that they carry Watermelon silver mottle virus that makes your leaves turn silver and shrivel up.<br /><br />The reason the leaves start dropping is that thrips love the warm dry air of a house or apartment and the parasite population explodes when you house the plant indoors as advertised.<br /><br />Anyway, in summary, they mention they are the biggest US distributor of bonsai, and I believe them, 'cause my bonsai has the parasites to prove it!

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', 'I cannot imagine why Ovaltine changed a perfectly good thing!  It is disappointing, I have to agree.

Even with my favorite marinara sauce, I just could not force down a full serving.  My feelings were echoed by the 3 other people in my office who tried them.  Even my husband who will eat almost anything, found the noodles unpleasant to eat and suggested that we NOT offer them to our clients.  If you have texture issues with food or you are buying them thinking they will replace pasta, forget it.  Despite the fact that we all eat a mostly vegetarian diet, these noodles gave us terrible gas, bloating and diarrhea the day after we ate them.

When I got it, my kids and I made lemonade: lemon juice, water and XyloSweet.  About 45 minutes later, halfway through lunch, I noticed my 6 year old daughter stopped eating her lunch, and she didn\\'t look too good. She told me she didn\\'t feel good and so I put her down for a nap. Ten minutes later, my son didn\\'t feel good either.  Long story short: my daughter got diarrhea, and luckily, because she hadn\\'t had that much lemonade, her diarrhea wasnt too severe.  Unfortuneately for my five year old son, who had a lot more lemonade to drink, he first started throwing up, and then also started having the runs--both at the same time!  Poor kid.  About the time I almost had them both settled down, my stomach was churning, and next thing you know I had to rush to the bathroom, for the first of what would end up being nine trips.<br />In between bathroom trips, I Googled: \"Xylitol reactions\" and was surprised at the number of listings that popped up.  I found that supposedly about 20% of people that try xylitol will have a reaction.  I think that figure is on the low side because my two kids are adopted from totally different sets of parents.  So when you consider that the three of us have different genetics, and yet we all had a problem with this stuff, I\\'d say that probably more than 20% of people that try this, will have a reaction.<br />BUYER BEWARE!  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ORSIJ4\">Xlear - Xylosweet 5lb, 5 lb, 1 bag</a>', \"This is the formula given to us in the hospital when our son was born.

Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters!

Ferrets are carnivorous, requiring quality proteins and fats, and sugar and carbohydrates are exceptionally bad for ferrets and puts them at great risk for a condition called insulinoma. Before we knew about diet and insulinoma in ferrets, we treated our ferrets to these per the instructions on the package and never really read the ingredients, trusting that a company marketing a product for ferrets would know what is safe and healthy to feed them. At about 4-5 years of age, all of our ferrets began displaying some strange symptoms: wobbly gait, staring off into space, increased urination, and later lethargy, extreme weight loss, inability to stand or walk at all, glazed eyes, and eventually a slow, painful death after 1-2 months of symptoms. It was horrifying, and agonizing to watch and have veterinarians say there is nothing that can be done at this stage. After consulting with many veterinarians after multiple ferrets displayed these same symptoms, we were able to narrow down exactly what was going on: insulinoma, caused by supplementing our ferret's diets with treats containing sugar and grains. We beat ourselves up over having caused our ferrets to live shortened lives by 1-2+ years just because we wanted to spoil them. These treats contain sugar as the first ingredient, which ferrets cannot properly metabolize.

The monk fruit, the basis of this sweetener, can be used in high-heat cooking, which Stevia cannot.<br /><br />But, read the label before you decide that this product is for you, because monk fruit is not the only ingredient. In fact, it\\'s the third ingredient of four:<br /><br />1.  Erythrytol -- it\\'s a sugar alcohol that\\'s 60 to 70 percent sweeter than sugar, which occurs naturally through the fermentation of fruits. Industrially, it\\'s fermented with glucose and a yeast. Unlike other sugar alcohols, erythrytol is less likely to cause gastric side-effects (gas and diarrhea) and it does not effect blood sugar.<br /><br />2.  Sugar<br /><br />3.  Monk fruit -- this fruit is 150% sweeter than sugar. It\\'s derived from luo han guo, which is a Chinese gourd family.<br /><br />4.  Molasses<br /><br />While the label says this is non-caloric, note there is one gram of carbohydrates listed on the label. That\\'s four calories per teaspoon. That\\'s less than the 15 calories per teaspoon of sugar and Nectress should not have the same effect as sugar on your blood glucose, but it\\'s still got calories and if you consume a lot of Nectresse, it\\'s going to add up.<br /><br />It\\'s debatable whether Nectresse is natural, either. Sugar comes from beets, which have been genetically modified. Also, the molasses and sugar alcohol components are suspect.<br /><br />Nectresse comes in a small plastic container with two pop-ups on the lid: one for pouring and the other for spooning. It looks like granulated sugar, the only difference is a slight peachy cast which I am guessing is from the monk fruit or the molasses.<br /><br />So--after all this explanation--how does it taste? I added Nectresse to a couple of my favorite teas to see. My initial impression was sweet--actually, much sweeter than the Stevia, which has become my go-to sweetener. A teaspoon will definitely sweeten a cup that would normally take two.<br /><br />The issue is the after-taste. It\\'s sweet and sticky and it lingers. I rinsed my mouth out twice before that taste left.<br /><br />No thanks, I\\'m sticking with Stevia.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, October 2012', 'Ordered this product along with the Large Kong Wobbler Red toy for our 3 dogs (weight in at 45 to 65 lbs each).

Don\\'t kill the messenger.<br /><br />It\\'s easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word \"Agave\" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It\\'s also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there\\'s zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it\\'s low-glycemic (we\\'ll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as \"diabetic friendly\". What\\'s not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it\\'s largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it\\'s commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it\\'s the fructose part of sweeteners that\\'s the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it\\'s considered a fiber. But there\\'s not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />\"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,\" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. \"Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses\", she told me. \"Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK\".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good for you.', \"It sounded like a great idea for a Halloween party, but I can't really say if these are any good or not.

Purchased in February of 2012.<br /><br />We have an extremely picky cat with health issues who will eat nothing but Whiskas Seafood pouches (not even the other Whiskas pouches). We've purchased this food from a number of different sources but noticed that it cost 50-70% less on Amazon, so we ordered a large quantity. Right as we started feeding our cat the food purchased on Amazon, he suddenly started leaving large amounts of food (which we had to throw away) and losing weight rapidly. We did not initially associate this with the food, and assumed it was a health issue, but could find no evidence of any problem. It was as if the cat suddenly had gone off his food.<br /><br />Fast forward three weeks or so: We've been feeding our cat Amazon's Whiskas, throwing away half of what he leaves in the bowl, and are still having no luck trying different types of food. Suddenly it occurs to me that his new 'health problem' started when we began giving him the Whiskas pouches from Amazon. So I examine the pouches, and here is what I find:<br /><br />- The packaging is in every way identical.<br /><br />- The consistency is much thinner. Where the gravy is thick and clings to the package in Whiskas pouches from Safeway/Petsmart/Petco, the gravy is watery in the Amazon version. This is best described as: The Amazon stuff immediately pours from the package, whereas the stuff from other stores has to be squeezed out and sticks to the side of the pouch.<br /><br />- The expiration dates on Amazon's pouches differs from the date on Amazon's boxes. The expiration dates on Safeway/Petsmart/Petco boxes is consistent: the same on the pouch as on its box.<br /><br />- Both Amazon and other food had an expiration date that was Jan/Feb/March of 2013, so nothing was expired and they were supposedly all manufactured around the same time.<br /><br />- Amazon's cat food is mysteriously WAY cheaper than even Petsmart. 50% cheaper. That is a suspiciously huge price difference for a 'grocery store item', even for Amazon's great prices.<br /><br />So I go to the store, get some more of Safeway's Whiskas Seafood pouches. As soon as I put it in the cat's bowl, he hungrily starts biting into it, as if he hasn't eaten in weeks. (and he barely has!) We finish the box of Safeway Whiskas pouches, and before contacting Amazon, I decide to switch back to the remaining Amazon pouches to see what happens: The cat doesn't eat it. Will not touch it. He won't even lick the gravy off of it, which is normally the first thing he does. I gave him the food this morning, and he hasn't eaten a bite. I let the other cats into his feeding room (they're on dry food but will eat his wet food when they get a chance), and not one of them touches the food.<br /><br />After the food has sat there completely untouched for about 10 hours, I go to amazon.com to initiate a return. Turns out you're not allowed to return this kind of consumable! However, knowing Amazon's history of being an exceptionally fair and honest company, I contacted customer service, and explained the problem to them. They immediately processed a refund, with full apologies, no need to return the item. (I'm throwing it away)<br /><br />So thank you Amazon for your outstanding customer service. I greatly appreciate it and will remain a frequent Amazon customer as I have been for 15 years. I've asked your customer service rep to open an investigation to find out if this cat food is counterfeit. I will apparently receive a report about the investigation.<br /><br />In the meantime I recommend to customers that you do not order the Whiskas Pouches through this page (maybe a different provider through Amazon would be fine). You may risk feeding your animals counterfeit (possibly harmful) food.\", \"I have been giving my senior dog these pill pockets for about two years now.  Up until recently they've been great.

So disappointing.\", 'This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this.

The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs.\" Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We\\'re talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn\\'t real meat in this food.

However, since then I've discovered that Westbrae uses cans with BPA in the lining.<br /><br />With BPA lining the cans and research showing solid levels of the chemical leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams (from infants to the elderly), I don't think the product can still be called organic!<br /><br />BPA leeching into our food is no better or safer than products sprayed with pesticides.<br /><br />At least pesticides can be washed off many foods (not all, but some). Most people, though, just empty cans of foods, like beans and tomatoes, directly into their recipes without thinking of washing them first. (How does one rinse or wash soup?) In fact, many people like the salt and other seasonings in canned foods. They believe it is safe to use the foods as they are in the can, which is a reasonable assumption since that is how such products are marketed.<br /><br />I know I quit adding salt to my own recipes containing canned foods many years ago, because the canned goods already had salt in them. The canning process is supposed to kill bacteria and preserve nutrition, just as home canning does. It wasn't until the information came out about BPA in our bloodstreams, and from where most of us are exposed to it, that I realized there was a problem using such foods as is. There are still many Americans who do not yet realize that there is a problem and they are unwittingly feeding that problem to their families.<br /><br />There is something especially unethical and tragic about people paying a company higher prices for organic foods, thinking they are better protecting their health, only to be swallowing BPA with each mouthful.<br /><br />Until Westbrae stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks for either context.\", 'This is for the regular flavor...<br />I give it zero starts, it was so bad.<br />Hard to believe this is food, and really hard to believe all of the good reviews.

On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.<br /><br />After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. \"Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds\".

Using it in my super automatic machine, I found it delicious - a medium espresso roast, well balanced, chocolate overtones. It was not excessively oily and easily fed through my machine.<br /><br />I was hooked.  So I subscribed to a 2-pack of 12.3-ounce cans.  They were horrible.  The beans were sour smelling and tasting. The expiry on the cans was April 16, 2013.  (Unrelated, one of the cans also had a fine animal hair between the lid and the seal, but this could have slipped in anywhere, including at the Amazon warehouse.)<br /><br />This may be just a batch problem - bad beans - however I will not purchase this product again.<br /><br />What a disappointment.', 'I thought I was getting natural flavorings but about half of these contain propylene glycol.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', \"$15 for this tub??<br /><br />This costs $3.50 at sam's club<br /><br />these people expect buyers to pay an extra 328% in price?\", 'I found this product to be totally INEFFECTIVE in regards to my woodchuck/groundhog problem.

She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing. How was I to know the substance would smell so badly? She said I should have just ordered one. What difference does it make since I had only opened one? The others were perfectly sealed. She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me. (Like I would anyway after that).<br /><br />I stand by my post.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', \"Have used the sugar-free Hazelnut syrup for a couple years now.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', \"My son really wanted these as he loves the other flavors. But They are DISGUSTING!!!

With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as High Fructose Corn Syrup!!!!<br /><br />Based on the labeling, I could picture native peoples creating their own agave nectar from the wild agave plants. Surely, this was a traditional food, eaten for thousands of years. Sadly, it is not.<br /><br />Native Mexican peoples do make a sort of sweetener out of the agave plant. It\\'s called miel de agave, and it\\'s made by boiling the agave sap for a couple of hours. Think of it as the Mexican version of authentic Canadian maple syrup.<br /><br />But this is not what agave nectar is. According to one popular agave nectar manufacturer, \"Agave nectar is a newly created sweetener, having been developed in the 1990s.\" In a recent article now posted on the Weston A. Price foundation\\'s website, Ramiel Nagel and Sally Fallon Morell write,<br /><br />Agave \"nectar\" is not made from the sap of the yucca or agave plant but from the starch of the giant pineapple-like, root bulb. The principal constituent of the agave root is starch, similar to the starch in corn or rice, and a complex carbohydrate called inulin, which is made up of chains of fructose molecules.Technically a highly indigestible fiber, inulin, which does not taste sweet, comprises about half of the carbohydrate content of agave.<br /><br />The process by which agave glucose and inulin are converted into \"nectar\" is similar to the process by which corn starch is converted into HFCS. The agave starch is subject to an enzymatic and chemical process that converts the starch into a fructose-rich syrup--anywhere from 70 percent fructose and higher according to the agave nectar chemical profiles posted on agave nectar websites.<br /><br />\"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,\" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. \"Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses\", she told me. \"Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK\".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good for you.<br /><br />If you simply must have some sweets, a small amount of agave nectar every once in a while isn\\'t going to kill you. Just don\\'t buy into the idea that it\\'s any better for you than plain old sugar or HFCS.<br /><br />Info is taken from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.<br /><br />So please.

Let me mention that I have a degree in science and a bunch, like a lot, of chemistry courses so I know that table salt, sodium chloride (NaCl) is really really soluble in water.  Well, after much stirring I got quite a bit of pink insoluble grains on the bottom of the glass and, most disturbing, the liquid was cloudy!  I\\'ve been watching it for a couple of hours now and nothing is settling out.  I\\'ll keep watching, but what the cloudy water means is there is either a fine particulate that will settle out in time or there is something else in the \"salt\" that is not or not completely water soluble or is colloidal, which does not make me feel good about this product.<br /><br />It is my understanding that most table salt is produced by crystallizing the salt from a saline solution, either natural (sea water) or man made.  The difference between \"regular\" table salt (at least in the US) and Kosher salt is that regular salt is allowed to crystallize undisturbed and will form cubical crystals while Kosher salt must be raked during the entire crystallizing process, thus forming the light flaky crystals familiar to that form.<br /><br />This product, it appears to me, is a mined mineral that contains a high NaCl content that is not further refined.  It is finely ground perhaps in the hope that end users will not notice that it also contains rock, sand, or whatever makes up the Himalayas.  The product claims to contain less Sodium (Na) and that may well be true, but is that lower Sodium content because it has ground rocks/sand in it?<br /><br />I\\'m returning this because it is an inferior product that is not what it is advertised to be.  This might be fine for a live stock salt lick but it is not fit for human consumption!<br /><br />Many Hours Later:  The cloudiness is clearing, so my conclusion is that it was caused by very small particles that took longer to fall out of suspension.  Nevertheless, sediment is sediment and sediment is not salt!

These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.\"<br /><br />Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:<br /><br />\"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.\"<br /><br />They conclude<br /><br />\"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.\"<br /><br />Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard\\'s nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook \"nutritional epidemiology\", and the most-cited author in his field.

The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate.

But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn\\'t know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they\\'re having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we\\'ve been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the \"customer service representative\" if you can call her that, simply said \"if you don\\'t like it then don\\'t buy it.\" And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it\\'s appearance nor did they add any \"stickers\" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn\\'t affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I\\'m sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it.', \"Gone through only four cans and it looks like I'm going to have to trash the remaining 20.  Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online.\", 'I haven\\'t opened the seal on these jars of turmeric just now received, but before I ordered I enlarged the size of the picture so I could see the weight.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', 'The stated shipping weight says eight pounds so I thought this was a bulk order.

It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!!

I noticed he had a bit more gas than usual coupled with some less solid poop, but I didnt really read to much into it. After giving him these treats he farted almost constantly! He also had diarrhea on a regular basis.Within a week of feeding him these on a regular basis he would stay in the squatting poop position for about three to five minutes every time he pooped trying to get more out. Once he got to the point that he was leaking diarrhea onto my floor it hit me. I called his vet who advised me to discontinue use of this horrid product. After which I looked up reviews and was horrified at what I read. This stuff is posion. Its killing dogs and cats. DONT LOSE YOUR BEST FRIEND OR WASTE YOUR MONEY! Find a better product.

However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours). It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this). The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see). Our other dog (adult) did fine, however. Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it\\'s just an unusual reaction, but if you google \"pill pockets diarrhea\", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.<br />Would suggest trying just one of these (or half of one) each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds.', 'I can still remember Captain Midnight sitting there in the uniform of an astronaut of the 50\\'s (khaki shirt and black four-in-hand tie) telling me solemnly that I should drink my Ovaltine because it tasted good and it was good for me.

You had to compromise by trying to round up the little critters on the spoon and that offered little comfort as the crunchy buggers didn\\'t taste all that great anyway.

Splenda and Equal have very little aftertaste for me, and blended in with other ingredients, I cannot detect any unpleasant taste from either, although I have friends who cannot stand to use them. Many years ago, I bought liquid Stevia sweetener, but the aftertaste, which to me had an anise flavor, was a turn-off. In the quest for a healthier sweetener, I decided to purchase a small box of Truvia, thinking that the powdered form might be more inviting.  Instead, it has the same disgusting bitter aftertaste that I remember from Sweet n Low. But like that sweetener, many people seem to enjoy Truvia and other Stevia products.

There is just enough cherry juice in there to give it a hint of cherry behind the apple and grape flavors.  For a cherry lover like myself, this drink was a disappointment.  Further, I think this drink is tremendously overpriced, considering it is just a little over 8 ounces of mostly apple and grape juice with some carbonation added.

I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I\\'ve had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill\\'s would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person\\'s pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can\\'t.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill\\'s about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I \"transitioned\" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of \"transitioning\" one\\'s pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don\\'t for one minute believe that my cat\\'s experience was an isolated occurence.

The bouquet has distinct peanut notes which is unsurprising as peanuts (which actually aren't a nut) are the main nut in the cereal.  Somehow this combines however, into a cereal that is at once both, overly sweet and mealy.<br /><br />I would also add that the price, $30 + $8 shipping comes out to about .88 an ounce.  Compare that to major grocery chains and other cereals, such as Crunchy Nut Roasted O's at .38/oz, or Honey nut cheerios at .28/oz, and its clear that these are horribly overpriced.<br /><br />Also, when it says nuts (and I realize I'm being a stickler), I really expect it to contain treenuts, like almonds, cashews, etc.  Peanuts are a legume, a groundnut, and technically a bean.

The same rep (female) who responded to my complaint in  Dec 2011 took my call today, but not knowing I had called before, she kept insisting there has never been a complaint about rancid bits before. I told her I called in Dec and she said \"someone else likely helped you\". Not wanting to argue, I moved on, but she clearly lied to me so I thought I should update about this. I was asked to include a note this time, to say where purchased but that has nothing to do with the fact that the company thinks it\\'s \"acceptable\" that some fat is getting thru via processing. Fat cannot be freeze-dried so it will turn rancid even if freeze dried - read my original review and see how this was answered the 1st time I called last year...Very disappointing that the company doesn\\'t care to hold the processing plant\\'s feet to the fire about fat getting in, but then to lie to a customer is not good. But they will honor their satisfaction guarantee! So the only way to get this issue resolved is for all of us to get refunds. All you need to do is send the proof of purchase and your invoice to the address on the bag, along with your name & address. I find that about half of the bags are rancid. Dogs don\\'t care, but cats won\\'t eat rancid anything so very expensive if issue is ignored. Pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund. Companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit. I hate to do this, but my cats beg for these and I\\'m going broke replacing rancid bags!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought two 6.2 oz bags of PureBites Chicken for dogs, first trying out a small cat size pouch found at PetSmart, and then moved up to the dog-sized bags/chunks, which I crumble with my fingers to get them smaller for my cats, who love this product BUT both of these bags purchased on Amazon had rancid chunks that smushed into slimy/greasy mush when I crumbled them.<br /><br />The company admits this happens, said it\\'s part of the processing, nothing can be done, but it\\'s not acceptable, and they will refund once I send proof of purchases & invoice to them.<br /><br />So it\\'s hit or miss, and the company agrees...so just an FYI to warn others to check their bags!<br /><br />For those feeding this to dogs, and not breaking up the chunks like I do, please take note of this and check on the chunks before feeding. You can also detect a faint rancid odor if there are rancid bits in your bags.<br /><br />The reason for the rancid chunks, according to the company is that pieces of fatty chicken do get in, and fat doesn\\'t freeze-dry, so without preservatives, it will go rancid. I knew that, but had hoped they could offer a promise to correct this; they can\\'t and have no intention to do so. So I\\'ll keep buying and hoping I get good bags, but will certainly take the time to get refunded whenever this occurs.<br /><br />The product is excellent when you get a good bag..just check each piece before feeding, or if you have a good nose for rancid odors, take a whiff and you\\'ll smell the slight rancid odor, and can return the product.', 'When I received this order, the outside of the box was wet from the leaking contents inside.

They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.<br /><br />I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover\\'s Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the \"voluntary\" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover\\'s Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn\\'t because I didn\\'t save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet\\'s assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that\\'s the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn\\'t the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.<br /><br />What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn\\'t begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn\\'t prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through \"other\" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it\\'s made by Diamond...RUN don\\'t walk in the opposite direction!!!!<br /><br />If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all.', 'I\\'ve used Cento San Marzano DOP certified tomatoes many times in the past and was always pleased with the quality of these great tomatoes.<br />That said, this is the 1st time I\\'ve ordered this item from Amazon and ALL 12 cans arrived completely dented and banged up!<br />Terrible presentation for an expensive item.<br />As an aside, none of the cans I received has a \"DOP CERTIFIED\" label but only \"CERTIFIED\" and no serial # on the side of the cans so I\\'m not sure if these tomatoes are actually DOP certified or not???', 'We had one of these cubes for 3 years for our English Springer Spaniel.

However, the smoke taste is so overwhelming that more than a proportion of 1:4 leaves only the taste of this product in your mouth. This product cannot begin to compare with the taste of the now-defunct Kraft's low-carb barbecue sauce. Mostly, I make my own low-carb sauce from scratch and then just add a bit of this to get the smoke taste, but too much and even the best batch of homemade sauce is ruined.

I don\\'t really care as long as people find out what\\'s real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill\\'s and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn\\'t think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn\\'t work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn\\'t work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I\\'ve had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn\\'t just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It\\'s amazing. And it\\'s 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad\\'s papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It\\'s incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn\\'t eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don\\'t feed your cat this. It\\'s garbage.', 'The product is fine, but the cost is exorbitant.

My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.\", \"THERE AREN'T ANY CANDY SEEDS ON THE WATERMELON TAFFY.

Chocolate bloom is characteristic of storing chocolate in warm conditions and of improperly tempering chocolate.<br /><br />Moreover, the manufacturer placed a batch sticker (050411) over the nutritional information on the back of the box. I attempted to peel back the sticker but still could not read nutritional information because the sticker did not come off. I have no idea how many calories are in the product, much less fat grams or fiber grams. Because the FDA required that nutritional facts are displayed on convenience foods sold in the US, a food manufacturer really should know better than to slap batch stickers over nutritional information. Likewise, Amazon should know better than to make improperly marked food products available for sale.<br /><br />I give these cookies 4* for the taste but took off 2* for condition.

Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she\\'s a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.<br /><br />So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It\\'s not Science Diet, that\\'s for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because \"it\\'s good for the cats and they love it\". Hmmm.<br /><br />I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to \"fatten her up\" with empty calories).<br /><br />You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.<br /><br />When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can\\'t do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.<br /><br />Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.', 'I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.

The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.

Again, not something I was looking forward to eating.<br /><br />Their texture is again very dry. They feel like small pebbles in my hand. After tossing them into my mouth, and crunching a bit, they are very juicy. I'm not sure if I like the flavor because I'm thrown off by the nasty after taste, like grain. I don't know if you've ever smelled rabbit food or grain for horses. (I grew up with horses.) This is what the stuff smells like to me. Moreover, I imagine had I tried grain, it would taste like that: grain and berries. Gross.<br /><br />I got the pack of two so I could give a pouch to my sister-in-law for Christmas. I hope she likes the berries. Perhaps they would be better in smoothies, but I'm reluctant to try.<br /><br />If they didn't have the funky after taste, I'd like them better. Oh, and the smell.

Recently while purchasing some specialty versions from a local store I saw the Jack Blacks Red Dead Root Beer and thought the label was cool so I grabbed a couple. After we sampled it, all I can say is don't waste your time. It has little to no root beer flavor,it finishes a little spicy in fact. It has caffine added which was a bit of a put off as well. I was very disappointed with the flavor of this product.

So I refrigerated it and when it cooled I tasted it again, again, Pear juice is all I could taste. I looked at the list of ingrediates to my surprise it read Pear juice first and Apricot puree next.  The puree I believe was supossedly for the color as it is not Apricot in color but very light orange. When ordered, it stated \"100% Apricot juice\", what I received was \"100% Fruit Juice Blend\" under that Apricot. To me this is very misleading as you can see by the picture it  states \"100% Apricot Juice\" and NOT \"100% Fruit Juice Blend\" which by the way tastes like \"Pear juice\".<br /><br />Save your money on this product and do more research first. Terrible, unless you like \\'Pear Juice\" which I do, but not when I expected \"100% Apricot Juice\".', 'The selection of K-Cups was not as pictured.

Although the bottles said Frosty, they all had generic gold caps and the 'root beer' was VERY light in color.  When opened the beverages were flat and had no carbonation.  I only purchased from Amazon because the local Rural King only sold individual bottles and they were to be a gift.  Will have to go back to Rural King and buy 12 to put in the shipping box these came in, as they are a 'non returnable' item.  Do not recommend and will not buy again.\", \"Agree with some of the negative reviewers in that it tastes a lot like the packaged, instant hot cocoa mixes.  I use Cadbury's or even Safeway brand cocoa mix and boil the milk and all that - but as I do have a Keurig machine (actually Cuisinart now - Keurig brand did not last a year!) wanted to try this since it's at my grocery store.<br />It's very sweet.  It seems to be creamier than the packet versions (no lumps of powder) but it is definitely sweet - and as much as I like sweet this was just too much.  Maybe as other reviewers have stated it is because it is made with a sweetener rather than sugar.<br />So - no I wouldn't recommend this at all if you expect 'chocolaty' because you do get a 'sugary/strange sweetener' taste.\", 'I am so sorry I did not listen to the other reviewer.  These gumballs are tinier than anything I have ever seen sold in a package like this.  It takes about 6 of them to equal the size of one regularly-sized gumball.  I have posted a picture so you can see how small these gumballs really are.  The package clearly states \"25 cents\".  The fact that the Amazon reseller is charging nearly double that price is shameful.']\n"

      "[\"I ordered this for my 17 year old cat. She only has one tooth and is very finicky. She will only eat the seafood pate of Friskies. I thought the purchase was a great deal since it was cheaper than Walmart and I could have it delivered to my house for a free price. I thought this was a good idea.Well, I was wrong.My housemate and I wondered what that godawful smell was. After weeks of dealing with cockroaches scurrying under furniture and fruit flies perching everywhere, I found out where they were breeding. One of the cans arrived banged up and maggots decided to call it home. You think fresh cat food smells bad?I brought home a premature infant and was afraid of all of the germs that infested the place at the time. I did not want a single risk posed to him getting sick. So I kept him in his room until I found out where the funk was coming from.The moral of this story is unless you don't mind infestation and possible contamination, don't order cat food online.\", 'I put this in an area in the yard as suggested on the directions.  My dogs both went over to investigate immediately. Sniffed it and have never gone back!My dogs are 2 and 3, so maybe it would work with a puppy.', \"Just did not like Pamela's Oat Blueberry Lemon bars that much.  They did not have much taste.

Another reason was I do not care for blueberries that much.\", \"We've tried these bars several times in a few different flavors and they are always cross contaminated with dairy.  I think the chocolate actually contains milk so that may be the source of the problem. My kid's allergic so it's pretty easy to tell when a new food is causing a problem.They're delicious and the times we've tried them they are never stale or too hard to chew (like the other natural crispy rice bar that is actually dairy free).  Wish they didn't have a cross contamination problem.\", 'We found live black small insects crawling inside several of the unopened McCanns packs that I purchased from Amazon. I reported this to both Amazon and to McCanns customer service dept. Some called me from McCanns, apologized and sent an empty pre-paid carton to ship the item back to them for further analysis. She said that they would replace the item but never did. However, Amazon refunded my purchase amount. I threw away the packs that had live black insects in them. A total of four boxes. So, beware of live insects and look carefully before opening the packets if you buy these.', 'DO NOT BUY THIS K CUP - IT IS INSTANT COFFEE CRYSTALS IN THE CUP.TASTES AWFUL.VERY MISLEADING.', 'I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real \"premium\" dog foods brag that they've no corn.Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real \"premium\" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real \"premium\" dog foods do not have.In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients.

Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food.', \"My biggest problem with Amazon is their return policy, or lack thereof, on unopened grocery items.

Unfortunately, \"Happy Birthday\" wasn't on the cake ( not a big deal), but the icing had begun sliding off,too. Ok, Miami is hot and even with good packaging things don't always go right. What was really annoying was that the cake was so bad it had to be thrown away. My daughter couldn't even finish the first slice she had taken.

I have to eat over the garbage can because everything spills, then wash my hands because the incredibly thin layer of milk chocolate melts immediately. Refrigerated, it's not nearly as bad, but that's silly for a simple snack.As a single, it's entirely unsatisfying. It's so small that it's almost inert, it does nothing to stave off hunger or bring back alertness. They should have packed two to a pack, that would at least put a dent in it, while still being at comparable to all of their other bars; buy one of them instead. Just assume you'll need two at a time. Hey, there's such a thing as too few calories.What amazes me is that the label contains four different sugars: One sucrose, and three different ways of saying maltodextrin. Obviously NV believes consumers are stupid and will gladly try to hide the actual level of sugars (it would be the first ingredient if all four were added together).Note that they've just started selling boxes of 48 instead of 36 in stores, so Amazon might get them soon.\", 'The quality of the tea in this blend is probably fine.

I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time, I'll give him just half of the teenie. The next morning he didn't eat and he threw up bile and some of the food he ate from the night before. And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets!\", \"I am a huge Starbucks coffee fan. I love their coffee and drink it as often as I can. When I saw this Vanilla flavored coffee, though I am a coffee purist, I thought I would try it. Honestly, I've had pleasant vanilla coffee and this was far from it. The vanilla flavor was just strong enough to make it taste odd, but not strong enough to really identify the vanilla flavors. I would not recommend this coffee.\", 'This made me wish I was born without taste buds.  It tastes sickeningly sweet at first and has an absolutely horrible, disgustingly bitter aftertaste.  This tasted like it would be poisonous.

Seriously, this stuff is rank...it truly rots! When I placed the order, I was somewhat hesitant, given that it was not yet rated. But, then I thought, \"It's English tea...how bad can it possibly be?\" As it turned out, this was faulty logic, indeed.  After brewing for the prescribed time, the resulting liquid neither smelled nor tasted like tea, or raspberries, for that matter. It had a sickly sweet and decidedly chemical aftertaste. Needless to say, I would never purchase another product from this supplier. \"Caveat Emptor!\"', 'I bought this product because I love dehidrated fruits, but these pears taste awful.

This time, there was something wrong with the batch; I'm not sure if Amazon used a different distributor or something else happened. The coconut water tasted very strange, with a strong aftertaste, and there was a milky substance in the water, which I've never seen before (I've been drinking Zico for a while). The individual boxes also looked different -- the colors were off (flesh-tone instead of yellow), and the expiration date and batch info were printed differently. I can't recommend ordering in bulk from Amazon, even though it's so convenient and saves money. This isn't the first time I've experienced a bad batch -- as if the food company had sent a \"slightly imperfect\" batch to Amazon to get rid of it. I've had this experience with canned beans, food bars, and now Zico. It's such trouble to call and get a label and send it back and get a refund, especially if, as I did, you break down the boxes and store all the drinks away in the cabinet before you realize they're no good! Just a word of caution.', 'I have 4 dogs and all were sick on this food. One actually almost died. It had to be ressucitated.

My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.', 'There was only one bad review, so I decided to ignore it because most of the reviews were favorable. What a mistake. It is really watery and the taste is not the same of the convenient stores. Waste of money. I will not recommend this product.', \"I've been a fan of Jerky for years.  I bought, tasted, and nearly gagged on the GALLOPIN' PEPPER flavor Wild Ride Jerky.

How do people eat and enjoy this crud?  The only explanation I arrive at is they've never savored the exquisitely smooth and sprightly taste of true guacamole made with ripe avocados and fresh cilantro.I had to give this product one star because Amazon said so.  I guess that star could go for the unbelievably corny (no pun intended) \"new look, same great taste\" icon on the upper-left corner of the bag.  Its such a quaint reminder of the inane, inconsequential marketing style of the \"Mad-Men\" era I grew up in.', 'As much as our dogs enjoyed Lickety Stik, the cloying stench of \"savory chicken\" repulsed the rest of the family. The odor wafted off the stick and filled the room like a musky air freshener. We called it \"Icky Stik\" or \"Stinky Stik\" as the experience was so nauseating that no one volunteered to reopen the stick, despite pleas from our dogs.We tested the PetSafe Lickety Stik as part of the Amazon Vine program, which is to say the product arrived free. The company sent us the Savory Chicken flavor and we tested it with our Cockapoo and Miniature Schnauzer, both adult females. Neither dog had trouble figuring out how to advance the roller ball so they could taste the liquid. One warning: if you get this stuff on your hands you'll play heck trying to wash it off.A collective shudder ran through the family as we wondered: if Savory Chicken smells this bad, can you imagine inhaling a deep whiff of \"Braised Liver\" or \"Smoky Bacon\"? Worse yet, the company touts the product's portability and recommends carrying it in your purse. That's a bit risk since this stuff in the bottle is hardly perfume.The company says Lickety Stick consists of all-natural ingredients. Here's the list from the bottle: Natural Chicken Flavors, Cultured Milk Lecithin, Mixed Tocopherois (Natural Preservative - A Source of Vitamin E), Ascorbyl Palmtate (Source of Vitamin C), Rosemary Extract, Green Tea Extract.In summary, with so many better options available for dog treats, we cannot recommend Lickety Stick because of its foul smell, sticky ingredients and the serious risk to your purse should the bottle leak.Rating: One star.', \"i've been feeding my cats wellness for over six tears. i tried for a change. they weren't at all fond of this food. and as i read in other reviews they tended to leave the chunks of fruit and veggies behind in the bowl. i only fed them about a fourth of the bag, bought wellness again and gave the rest of the bag to my neighbor. i wanted this food to be well liked by my kitties, but it wasn't. they weren't into the soft food, either. but, they do LOVE the organix cheddar treats. sorry i couldn't say better things. i wouldn't recommend this food and will never purchase it again.\", \"I was anxious to buy the Boston Bean decaf breakfast blend k-cups for my husband.

But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the \"customer service representative\" if you can call her that, simply said \"if you don't like it then don't buy it.\" And then she hung up on me.The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any \"stickers\" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it.', 'Beef Jerky has always been one of my favorite snacking foods.  I even used to make my own when I was younger.  I've tried a variety of brands before but this is the first time trying out Wild Ride.  It claims to be Hormone and Nitrate free with no added MSG, and while the ingredients listed do confirm their claims this beef jerky has got to be some of the driest, tasteless I have ever eaten.Kickin' Teriyaki is the flavor I got.  To be sure I didn't just get a bad package I opened two bags and both sets of jerky was dry and tasteless.  I do not taste anything \"kickin\" about this jerky and there is virtually no Teriyaki flavor either.  To make things worse the dry jerky tends to have a powdery taste to it because it is made with Soy Sauce POWDER instead of Soy Sauce (this is to get around saying it has no added MSG).  Instead of imparting a nice Teriyaki flavor you get this powedery taste to the jerky and mixed with the bit of onion and corn starch in the jerky, it almost is like they coated it with onion powder instead of Teriyaki.On the plus side however, this is a nitrate free product which is a good thing as many other jerkies tend to have Sodium Nitrate in them.  Also with both packages I have opened currently, the jerky breaks down easily and isn't tough as leather nor does it contain any sinew it seems.OVERALL this jerky just seems extremely tasteless and powdery.  While it doesn't contain \"added\" MSG, Nitrates or hormones, they got around this by using powdered versions of ingredients (powdered vinegar and soy sauce) plus it contains Dextrose and Fructose , modified food starch and corn starch and SUGAR is your second ingredient.  I've never seen so much sugar and starch added to jerky in my life.  So despite being hormone and nitrate free, this jerky (in my opinion) is barely palatable and should be avoided', \"Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.  She seems fine today, but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae, I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well.\", 'About 40% packets had no sugar in them and a bunch others were open and leaking.

Single-serving coffee pads have been around for a long time. I encountered them first in England in the early 1960s. They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again.

As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials.

This bag of basmati rice was packaged well, packed well for shipping, and shipped promptly.  But the rice itself is very disappointing.  It's instant rice, and not very good instant rice at that, with a basmati flavor.  It cooks in ten minutes to a mushy pasty individual grain.  What with having ten pounds of it, I've tried cooking it every way that rice can be cooked, just in case I was preparing it incorrectly. Nope, tastes like someone made rice mush and then extruded it thru small holes and re-dried it. My family and I enjoy whole grain rices that generally take 55 minutes to cook and allow you to have a pleasant flavor and distinct individual grain texture to the mouth. I even tried using it as a filler for meat loaf or meat balls. It decreases the quality of any recipe you use it in.  The only explanation for all these rave reviews that I can see is that they're generated by the company, or that the purchasers have never tasted real rice before.  This stuff is awful.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.', 'This was a Mother's day gift which arrived completely melted.  My Mom called them and told them of the condition. They told her that I should have requested \"special packaging\".  REALLY?!?!  For a CANDY company?!  They requested she either send the package back or send a picture via email.  Now, my mom is 75 years old, homebound and on oxygen due to severe lung disease.  She had her neighbor take a picture and email it to this company.

You can see bits of garlic, onion and (minimal) spices in the sauce but the flavor has been completely boiled out of it to point that all that's left the bitter part of the garlic and the acidic part of the tomatoes. To say the flavors don't blend is an understatement. There are any flavors to blend in the first place.I would be embarrassed to be Mario Batali right now. Obviously he has traded his expertise and food quality for the money making machine.I severed this to good friends and they all agreed it wasn't a good sauce and that they would prefer not to have it again.

In fact, Twinnings is my favorite brand of hot tea - and I drink hot tea several times a day - so I am guessing I must not like Oolong tea.  I had high hopes for this Oolong tea - the description on the box was most inviting.My first hurdle in trying to drink this tea (after steeping a few minutes in my tea cup) was the smell.  Oh, and what a smell it is - like freshly turned earth with a sour note - difficult to describe, but nauseating nonetheless.  And if I thought the smell was bad, the taste was even worse (and I didn't think that was possible).  Oh, how to describe - like muddy water with sharp grassy notes - at least to me.  My husband laughed when he saw me sip this the first time - he said the look on my face was the same expression I had when I would change our son's diaper after he left a particularly large gift to clean up.So, I think I will just stick with my beloved Irish Breakfast, Earl Grey, Lady Grey, and English afternoon teas by Twinnings.  From reading the reviews, it looks like my lack of love for this tea will not be a problem.\", 'This is the most expensive loose tea I have purchased so far.  I have not strayed from the Davidson's loose bulk here on Amazon at such a great price but thought I would give this one a try.

I do however have a HUGE problem with stray hairs in my loose tea.  The first time I scooped some out and noticed a long hair (and not the color of mine) in with the tea I was grossed out but thought \"Hey it happens\".  The second time I found another hair down further in the bag (oddly enough a different color and longer) it completely repulsed me.This isn't bad tea, but I would say there's a quality control problem in filling the bags.  Needless to say that I won't be buying this brand any more and back to Davidson's cheaper (and hair free) tea for me!', 'Considering you can get 105 oz for $76 at Costco, this is not a good deal.

The flavor is strange.', 'My Black Lab has been eating Canidae All Life Stages dry dog food since we switched her from puppy food to Canidae in early 2006.  Our breeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :\"Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.\"They ended their response with this condescending comment :\"We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.\"After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The \"Canidae Team\" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?', \"This jam is really good, but serioulsy, the price is just not right.

I posted this review for the \"Natural Light\" variety, and it was originally on that page.  Now that the \"Natural Light\" was discontinued, they moved my review to this version where it doesn't apply.  However it is still true that the company which purchased Orville Redenbacher, ConAgra, no longer is making a less salty, 3.5oz/bag popcorn with unrefined palm oil.  This is a shame as no one else is either.  Despite what amazon.com has been doing, this is not an acceptable substitute for the other product and shouldn't be sent without permission to people who had the \"Natural Light\" on subscription delivery.  And after over a year of complaints, the bag size in the description should have been corrected.  Amazon.com, this is really shoddy behavior, and leads me to think it is a matter of mega-companies sticking together to scam customers out of our hard-earned cash.This review has been edited to reflect the mfr.'s change of the product.When I first reviewed this popcorn, I was describing the popcorn as it was in 2006.  It was made w/ very healthy unrefined palm oil containing nutritious beta-carotene and no trans fats.  It was also 3.5oz per bag.The mfr. has degraded the product.  It's now made w/ partially hydrogenated soy oil that has trans fat, and they've shrunk the bag to 2.9oz..  It's not any healthier or tastier than econo-brands now, but it is still much more expensive.  You also have to cook it for less time than is printed on the bag b/c of the smaller amount or it will burn.Whenever a good product is cheapened like this I always do an online search to see if the company was acquired, and sure enough, ConAgra bought Orville Redenbacher.  If you scan the reviews you'll see that almost all the 5-star reviews were written before 2007.  So don't bother complaining to the company about the decline in quality, b/c they don't care.', 'The description of this item said \"2-Count\" so I expected it to have two bones.

I'm very happy with Bob's Gluten-Free Pancake Mix, so this was a surprise.\", \"I was given a sample by my vet and my cats LOVED the stuff. I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!\", \"Even though this appears to be intended for dogs, I bought this for my cat Digby. He is very smart and likes puzzle toys (the ones that conceal treats of course). The problem with this toy is the depth of the 'bowls' that hold the treats. Digby cannot get his snout deep enough into the bowls to get the food. I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat. This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it. If your pet can lick the inside bottom of a jelly jar, perhaps this will be a good item to get them.\", \"My dogs destroyed this ball in less than 20 minutes.

I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.

As he's getting older, I thought I'd go for the LITE since I'm sure regular Greenies have a lot higher calories.  So I bought Greenies LITE (teenie, 96 pack) and he sniffed at the first one and literally pushed it away with his nose and several more attempts have gone unsuccessful and I've been just handing them out to my friends' less-picky dogs.  Had to buy a tub of Greenies regular and surely enough, he sniffed at it, did his dance, grabbed it and ran away (well, he was so happy he skipped away) with it.  When I smell it, the regular definitely smells better/more appetizing whereas the LITE has the blah~ smell to it.  So if your dog already had a taste of regular Greenies, I suggest you stick with the regular.\", \"beware  - this is a spice mixture only, not actual harissaNot what I intended to order, but the ad wasn't clear.Harissa as I ate it in North Africa was a pulpy mash of peppers and spices, some oil.

I liked the smooth texture and the ingredients seemed alright, no high-fructose or partially dehydrogenated oils listed. The prices was a bit expensive but I thought I'd give it a whirl!  End result was: it was just too salty to tolerate.  I tasted a teaspoon of this and could tell right away.  I roll the jar label over and notice that, low and behold, it's got 190mg of sodium PER SERVING.  Considering one serving is two tablespoons, that's a heck of a lot of salt for one little jar.  In fact, 1/4th of the jar would just contain salt.  I don't see how this is a healthy option at all!  It's a good thing that I'm young and don't have any cardiac problems or high blood pressure because if I did, this stuff would just make it worse!  And at 4.99 per bottle, that's an expensive mistake to make, food-wise.  My advice is just to skip it!  Get the nonsweetened nonsalted peanut butter instead and have that with jam.

Well I thought perhaps they were just too haughty, and I offered to take the rest.  I finally tried one last night, and now I know why it was given away by the previous taster.The Mocha flavored Via is disgusting.  Rather than having any flavor of chocolate at all, it has a strong artificial sweetener taste - as if someone dumped in a package of saccharine and called it cocoa.

This time however, upon arrival it was not same company, packaging or label (hokey looking)... Instead of \"Frontier\" it said \"Organic Herbal Essence\".  Upon further investigation I went to my Amazon history and noticed first batch came from Sold by: Bangalla Organic Wholesale LLC and second batch came from Sold by: Organic Herbal Essence.  Keep in mind that Organic Herbal Essence is the cocoa that sells on Amazon that is only rated at 2-stars:[...]  I checked and can't return it. Called Organic Hebal Essence during business hours, left message, no one returned my call.  My opinion is just slapping a tiny white Avery label on the bag with tiny print (really tiny) that says \"Frontier Cocoa\" doesn't eliminate the huge color label on the bag that says \"Organic Herbal Essence... Dutch Cocoa\".  it certainly doesn't turn a 2-star cocoa into a 4 1/2 star cocoa.

I found only one half of a peanut in one of the two sections of the candy bar.Cons:Much of the candy bar is chalk full of artificial flavors and fillers.

This masala chai has a strongly imbalanced flavor; these same spices mixed with more black assam tea would produce a strong tea beverage, not bitter (steeping tea extra long releases bitter tanins, not more tea flavor), with a very pleasant flavor from the spices.  As-is, it is a failure.Since this costs as much as Irish Breakfast Tea bags, and I assume that the spices aren't free, it is my deduction that tea quantity is significantly lower in this particular blend.  Notably, if you were to use loose tea of the same composition, you would use more of it; although I imagine then the spice blend would be overpowering.  The best course would be to use loose Chai tea of the normal blend, and use more total quantity to raise both the tea and spice concentration together; or, for more spice, you would use an in-between blend, but again greater total quantity.This Chai tea is overbalanced towards spice; the total volume is too low for a proper balance.\", \"I have never reviewed an item before, but taking the time to review the Baby Brezza because of the unfortunate experiences I have had with this product and to warn people not to spend $100 on such a poorly made product.. I read multiple reviews on the Baby Brezza and read some negative reviews about the blade not working. But I tend to go with positive reviews if they outweigh the negative ones, but from now on, I will definitely reconsider buying anything with negative reviews, and the Baby Brezza purchase has actually discouraged me from buying anything from Amazon that is expensive and can be broken, as you cannot return the product after 30 days.I bought the BB in February 2012 and should have returned it right away after I had some problems from the beginning, but I was too excited to use it so I did not.1. The cover never fit quite right. The manual said that the blade has two positions, up for steaming and down for blending, and obviously up if you are going to steam/blend but it did not seem like the blade had 2 positions and I always had to readjust the cover to make it fit, turning the blade slightly down from the up position so the cover would close and lock.2. I bought the grain basket accesory and it never fit! The cover just would not close, it was much too tall! That should have been the final indication that I had a defective BB but it was so much trouble to return the product to Customer Service and I just played phonetag with them!I was still able to use it for the purposes I wanted, to steam and blend fruits and veggies so I just kept using it for a while til the final third thing happened!3. The whole thing just broke! The driveshaft and blade just popped off one time! Blade just would not turn!Called customer service. Terrible experince except for one rep that was really nice whom I had been playing phonetag with. Before I talked to the rep I really liked, the two I spoke with including the manager were rude and unhelpful. Granted, I called when I was upset and was probably mean myself but I thought customer service people's job is to make the customer happy, which I learned at 14 years old at my first job at a restaurant. They argued with me, displayed frustration even mild anger with their voice as well as impatience when I asked if I can get a full refund. They said I would have to return the product and wait for it to be inspected, and maybe I will get a refund. They also said that I could not get a refund on the grain basket as they do not give refunds for accesories and the first rep even argued with me asking if I had left the blade in when I put in the grain basket, which is impossible to do if you wanted to put in the grain basket at the same time.So I asked to speak with the rep I had been playing phonetag with, and she was really nice, patient, and tried to keep her customer happy. She offered to send a new Baby Brezza without me sending in the broken one, a new grain basket that she said she would make sure it fit, and another free accesory of my choice. The new BB along with the other two products came quickly, few days and so I was a happy customer again!The new one I received is different from the one I originally bought. The blade was a different color, more brown instead of orange, the driveshaft lock at the bottom of the pitcher was configured diffrently, and the blade had 2 definite positions, up and down, the cover fit perfect, and the grain basket fit. But guess what!4. This time the blade was broken. It still works but the top part that twists comes off, which I didnt think was a big deal as it still worked but when I was cleaning it, the bottom with the blade part fell off and almost hit my dog! I checked the old BB i had and the top of the blade did not come off so...I called the nice rep again. She sent me a new pitcher, driveshaft, and blade. She didn't send me any new accessories for my trouble when I asked, but she was still very nice. I did tell her that this new BB is a lot better than my first one and she said the one I have is from a different line, so their product is not even standard!5. Got it the mail today, the top of the blade still came off! I left a message with the nice rep again but this is now ridiculous. My baby is one year old and I donT even use it as much anymore!So hence, why I am writing this review. Save your money and trouble and get a steamer and a handheld blender to make babyfood. Oh, I used the grain basket to make small sized pasta like it suggests, not big size pasta. It came out like paste, all stuck together!  And I made same pasta in a saucepan in 5 mins and it was fine. Grain basket took 25 mins and pasta was one solid, pasty mess when it was done! So just boil pasta in a saucepan.Originally gave  it two stars for the nice rep but changing it to one star. If it was not so cheap and a poorly made product with all the malfunctions, I would have been happy with it. Should have gotten the Beaba fron William and Sonoma, maybe they at least would take back a broken product without me packing it in a box, going to usps, spending money, to get my $100 back! Or they should only charge $40 for the BB, not $100 or have the accesories go with it for free! I guess that is what you may get with products made in China.Addendum: my husband just told me that he noticed there is water leaking in the back when it is on steam mode, when the first one did not do that. It seems like the second BB we have has a new set of problems. When I decided to buy the Brezza earlier this year (2012) there were only a few one star reviews compaining it did not work. I just read the current ones and there are so many one star reviews complaining of the same defects I experienced or different ones that really scare me like oil leaking that I donot want to use this product anymore. I would not have bought it if  I was reading the same reviews back when I decided to buy it. I am goIng to call Amazon to see if they can issue me the refund. It is near impossible to get a live person on the Brezza customer service and they do call back, but it takes a while and it is so incovenient. And with a product like this that you use a lot for only a limited amount of time when baby eats babyfood, it is really a rip off to not just send someone a replacement right away. Planning to call Amazon to see if they can take a look of how many complaints there are of this defective product and not sell this product anymore. It is a disservice to loyal customers of amazon. Makes me want to stick to brick and mortar stores so you don't have the inconvenience and frustration of not getting a refund or a replacement immediately. Maybe for some people, $100 is nothing but for us, $100 was an investment of a product I was planning to use well into my baby's toddler years to sneak in pureed vegetables in their spaghetti sauce like the BB site advertises. Cannot do that with a poorly made product that is only on warranty for a year!\", \"Yuck! This has to be one of the worst tasting teas ever.

I got it when it was a brand new product line by them (new enough to get $1 off coupons, the REAL reason I tried them since they were barely over a dollar after the discount).The smell I agree with the 1-star review is really off putting... and it matches the taste PERFECTLY.What the taste IS? BABY FOOD. JUST LIKE BABY FOOD.When I got the lentil one with the coupon, I only got one... then went back and got the rest, along with a few of these (I haven't braved the mushroom yet). I wish I'd only gotten one. A dollar and change or not, NO WAY am I keeping them. I wouldn't even donate them. I added ground pepper... nope, baby food plus pepper. Sea salt made a bite of it almost edible--yknow, thick salty broth--and adding a touch of herbs just ruined the herbs.The reason it can't be salvaged? Their chicken is repulsive. I'm almost sure they boiled the bird, and that is only acceptable for broth where the bird gets removed. In fact, I have a hunch--especially given the whole thing possessed ONE tiny flaky pea sized square of meat--they got \"responsible\" and took the bird etc used for the broth--the broth strained out and packaged--and just blended that boiled limp weird-odor meat and such and tossed in some rice flour and dairy to try passing it for soup.Ever made your own broth, the kind where you boil it til the bird is almost Michael Jackson white because you aren't going to use it as part of the dish and want to yank all its flavor out? You know how funky boiled, denatured bird smells and tastes? This is that bird. Now I have finally figured out why baby food is so repulsive, a mystery I was content to never even ponder. I hate that I am dumping the remaining 90% of this out, but I'll be tasting it coming back up if I don't (4 tiny spoonfuls and it already has me belchy and nauseous!).

I have to say that I was one of the unfortunate few folks who experienced side effects so dramatic (extreme heart rhythm interruption, loss of vision, numbness in the arms and hands, etc.) that I will never try one of these drinks ever again.  The impacts to my heart (I typically have great blood pressure and heart rate from years of exercise and road bike racing/riding) were so over the top that I had no patterned rhythm and I ended up in the emergency room after passing out from a huge drop in blood pressure.  My vision became blurry and eventually tunneled, and the EMT squad who responded to the 911 call (we initially thought I was having a heart attack) could not get any regular heart beat for about 15 minutes (and this took four baby aspirin and a nitro pill).Interestingly enough, other members of our group who also tried the 5 hour energy drink experienced a nice rush of energy and felt great, others in the group basically stated that the mixture tasted like dirty water and had absolutely no effect whatsoever.  I guess this basically tells me that the ingredients (at least for this brand of energy drink supplement) really react differently for everyone.  I did notice that the drink provides a warning about not consuming more than two in a specific period of time.  For me at least, the bad reaction was enough to warn me away from trying these ever again.', 'just received a case of 12 chicken & brown rice formula...every single can was dented beyond use...this was a problem before and supposedly amazon was to get their shipping problem with this item corrected...it states that this item is not returnable although damaged, i wrote to amazon requesting a return label and credit ...will see what happens...i want to return the case of food so they can see the damage, there were 4 air pillows in the box but they had holes torn in them so they were flat and just laying on top of the food...ordered this product from another website while waiting for amazon to straighten out their shipping problem, the other company sent the order UPS and the case of food was surrounded by the Styrofoam pellets and not a dent one !...UPDATE...

This product is widely used in Thai restaurants where the cooks don't want to cook, and don't want to invest the time in training workers who change restaurants every 6 months...they just want to hire untrained laborers who can open cans and scoop pre-made mixes out of containers.  It takes a bit of time and practice to make curry paste, but do it a few and you can master the art of working with the spices.

After reading a few other reviews on the strange packaging, I was almost afraid to open it - who knows what I would find. My daughter had a strong chocolate urge so we pulled off the wrappers.Oh my gosh, it is hard to know what to say. What was this company thinking?Let's start with the packaging. At first glance the basket looks simple yet classy and attractive and boasting what appears to be an assortment of delectable chocolates. That illusion is lost once you have opened the package. There are paper wrappings around boxes with the product name. But the actual boxes are for common grocery items like jello, fruit loops, flan etc. Can you imagine diving into a box of truffles that say Kenzi on the surface only to find the box below is for jello? A box of jello whose expiration was several years ago. How long does one keep old cereal boxes around, but more importantly, why would you package gift basket chocolate in old jello and cereal boxes?One of the boxes has a computer generated label that has been cheaply made and taped to it.So what is in the box? Well in one I pulled out a bag of peanuts that had melted and then solidified in one chunk. In another were small brown things that I believe were supposed to be truffles. There were also some wrapped cheap chocolate such as a chocolate graham cracker.The entire basket was unappetizing and unappealing. I can't share how the chocolate tastes, because after pulling it out of jello and flan boxes and seeing the melted condition, there was no way I was eating it despite my love for chocolate.With proper packaging and shipping, there would be a much better result but as it is now, it should not be for sale.This is definitely not a gift basket you will want to give.\", \"The description on this item does not specify that this is the LOW SODIUM Homestyle Chicken Noodle, though the  picture does say so if you look closely.  Sadly, Campbell's appears to have discontinued the regular Homestyle chicken noodle (I cannot find it in any grocery stores, or online) and only offers the healthy request and low sodium options.  The low sodium is AWFUL!!  The flavor is completely flat and almost tasteless, and adding salt does not improve it.I can understand offering healthier options for parents and others who need to avoid sodium, but I'm ticked off that Campbell's has taken away the regular flavor.  I will say that the price here is reasonable - Campbell's soups are approaching $2 a can in many supermarkets - especially if you subscribe.  I would happily subscribe if this were the regular Homestyle.  As it is, I can't recommend this flavorless soup.  I'd rather make my own.\", \"I don't think I have ever given 1 star to any product but this one deserves it. I am a weak coffee drinker and this taste like water.

In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves.What should you drink?

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.', \"This is my very first review - I thought these were genuinely terrible.

They were in no way up to the standards of the ones I had before. From now on, if I want a chocolate turtle, I'll go to a candy store and get them fresh.

Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.

I purchased two 2-packs of it at my local grocery store, intent on trying one out in the morning in order to wake myself up early.  First of all, these are grossly overpriced.  At the store, a 2-pack sells for $6.  You can buy a huge coffee drink for the price of one of these little 2-ounce bottles (I don't drink coffee, but I'm just giving that as an example).  Even with the \"discounts\" that are offered through Amazon or the various third-party sellers, they're still overpriced.Now, I'll detail what happened this morning when I tried a 5 Hour Energy for the first time:By the time I'd gotten up the nerve to open the bottle and drink the contents, I was basically awake.  So it did, in fact, manage to wake me up, but not in the way I was expecting.  The first thing I noticed as the liquid touched my tongue was the taste.  The awful taste.  It was like a super-saturated sugar solution, only the sweet taste had been replaced with a terrible bitter sensation that has stuck with me almost two hours after consuming the drink.  So if you enjoy having a terrible taste stuck in your mouth, even after flushing your mouth out with water and even brushing your teeth, this may be the product for you.  Otherwise, steer clear.The second thing I noticed was that, contrary to its advertisement, it DID NOT give me an energy boost whatsoever.  I still had to drag myself out of bed like I do every day.  Even now, nearly two hours after consuming this awful liquid, I am not filled with energy.  I did, however, feel an elevated heart rate shortly after consumption, and I do feel a little jittery right now.  I'm also finding myself a little more irritable than I usually am in the mornings, and it's difficult to concentrate on even writing this review.  I think it may have even given me a stomachache.So, for those of you who want a bullet point summary, here you go:Cons----Awful taste that doesn't go awayGrossly overpriced even with the discounts that online retailers haveDoesn't actually give you energyPossible elevated heart rate upon consumptionJittersInability to concentrateMight make you irritableMay cause stomachachesPros----If you're tired of carrying all that money around, this could be a great way to make your wallet or purse a little lighter.Simply put (if you don't feel like reading the Wall of Text up above), DO NOT buy this product.  It is, by far, one of, if not THE, worst products I've ever purchased in my life.  And I've bought a lot of junk.  Don't buy into the false advertising.  Stay away.

This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients).  Here is what the FDA says on its web site:\"It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a \"stew,\" \"in sauce,\" \"in gravy,\" or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter).\"On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can).  The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients.  Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight.  Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight.  So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet.So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva.

I received the Tea Bags but not the Passion Iced Tea. I inquired with Starbucks to follow-up on the missing merchandise. Starbucks advised that the PITFB were mailed out in a separate box from the Earl Grey bags but in the same shipment. I advised that I only received one box with the shipment. At first Starbucks emailed me that the  me that I would receive a subsequent shipment.\"Thank you for contacting Starbucks Online Ordering.We apologize for the inconvenience you have experienced with your order.After further research, all of the items shipped out but separately.Please allow 5 to 10 business days to receive the remaining part of yourorder.\"When no new order ID generated after 10 days, I called Starbucks and was told that they would not send out a new shipment. Starbucks advised that they checked their inventory and because their \"counts matched\", a replacement would not be sent and they could determine that the passion iced tea had been mailed.I asked for the tracking number that was associated with the PITFB so I could investigate further. Starbucks stated that they sent two separate boxes but with one tracking number. Starbucks insisted that I file a claim with the carrier. I spoke with the carrier who stated that each box should have a tracking number. The one tracking number that was given with the order was delivered (the earl grey tea bags)so UPS could not honor a claim on the second box because there was no second tracking number on the missing merchandise. Starbucks response was that because UPS would not honor their claim (because Starbucks didn't only used one tracking # for 2 boxes) that I was out of luck and nothing further could be done.Starbucks, a company that I have traditionally enjoyed doing business with, has discouraged me from purchasing their products again...on Amazon or otherwise. The customer service agent and his supervisor's inability to address the shipping department's error and take no responsibility for seeing the transaction through is incredibly disappointing.

Packs available from other sources are much more generous in their content.

The individual packetts are still on the skimpy size.  There were some extra packetts, so if you discard the ones with only three or four pieces of candy corn, you might end up with 70 that each have about 7 pieces of candy corn.

I watered and inspected the tree and found little (.5mm) silver mites running around in the soil-- lots of them.I did a lot of research and then eventually took it to a local nursery where they said and my bonsai came with a nice little infestation of thrips palmi.Thrips are a common glasshouse and factory nursery infestation that attack the roots of young plants. To an adult plant, thrips themselves do minimal damage even in large numbers but can stunt or warp growth by feeding on terminal shoots, the undersides of leaves, causing them to drop. Each of my dropped jade leaves had a small brown spot at the base where thrips had been feeding. The real danger from thrips is that they carry Watermelon silver mottle virus that makes your leaves turn silver and shrivel up.The reason the leaves start dropping is that thrips love the warm dry air of a house or apartment and the parasite population explodes when you house the plant indoors as advertised.Anyway, in summary, they mention they are the biggest US distributor of bonsai, and I believe them, 'cause my bonsai has the parasites to prove it!

My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.', 'I cannot imagine why Ovaltine changed a perfectly good thing!  It is disappointing, I have to agree.

I had hoped that I could recommend them to my weight loss clients.  Unfortunately things just did not work out.  First of all, the liquid they are packaged in smells horrible!

Even with my favorite marinara sauce, I just could not force down a full serving.  My feelings were echoed by the 3 other people in my office who tried them.  Even my husband who will eat almost anything, found the noodles unpleasant to eat and suggested that we NOT offer them to our clients.  If you have texture issues with food or you are buying them thinking they will replace pasta, forget it.  Despite the fact that we all eat a mostly vegetarian diet, these noodles gave us terrible gas, bloating and diarrhea the day after we ate them.  On a positive note, the company was very nice and allowed us to return unopened bags.', 'Yup just another waste of $$ buying something I thought my dogs would like but its quite obvious they wouldnt even chew on this if it were the last chew on earth.', \"My cans arrived last week, and I was a little surprised that most of the cans were dented, but I figured, no big deal, just some rough shipping or something.

When I got it, my kids and I made lemonade: lemon juice, water and XyloSweet.  About 45 minutes later, halfway through lunch, I noticed my 6 year old daughter stopped eating her lunch, and she didn't look too good. She told me she didn't feel good and so I put her down for a nap. Ten minutes later, my son didn't feel good either.  Long story short: my daughter got diarrhea, and luckily, because she hadn't had that much lemonade, her diarrhea wasnt too severe.  Unfortuneately for my five year old son, who had a lot more lemonade to drink, he first started throwing up, and then also started having the runs--both at the same time!  Poor kid.  About the time I almost had them both settled down, my stomach was churning, and next thing you know I had to rush to the bathroom, for the first of what would end up being nine trips.In between bathroom trips, I Googled: \"Xylitol reactions\" and was surprised at the number of listings that popped up.  I found that supposedly about 20% of people that try xylitol will have a reaction.  I think that figure is on the low side because my two kids are adopted from totally different sets of parents.  So when you consider that the three of us have different genetics, and yet we all had a problem with this stuff, I'd say that probably more than 20% of people that try this, will have a reaction.BUYER BEWARE!  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ORSIJ4\">Xlear - Xylosweet 5lb, 5 lb, 1 bag</a>', \"This is the formula given to us in the hospital when our son was born.

Logically we continued to run with this brand.We began feeding him the powdered stuff because it is cheaper and we would often buy 10 - 20 of the larger containers at a time (we live in a somewhat rural area).  We were very dismayed to learn that there was a voluntary recall on this product but were happy to hear that it was only a small batch from a certain area that was affected.  It turns out this is not the case.  We compared containers on the list from approximately 6 - 9 months ago that were purchased almost a 1,000 miles away (we had moved) with ones we had recently purchased locally.  To our dismay both containers were on the recall list.At the premium price we pay for formula we expect that the company has good enough quality control systems in place to prevent bug arms and legs from making it into the container - hasn't anyone heard of a sifter?

I could mail a bag of potato chips (of most major brands) and the chips ought to survive the trip intact.The powder tastes okay. But crushed that much, I can't really consider this a snack anymore.

I pumped all the air out of a bottle that the unit was capable of and let it sit for a few hours.  After only maybe 6 hours, the stopper was so easy to pull out (without releasing pressure first) there is no way there was much of a vacuum at all left in the bottle.

One day he began having diarrhea and refused to eat... I thought, no big deal dogs get tummy upsets once in awhile, right?  But he didnt get better.  His Belly and hind legs started to swell so much that the skin looked like it would tear...  multiple labs and fecals showed kidney disease of unknown cause.  He has had ultrasounds, multiple blood and urine cultures, a plasma transfusion and is now on multiple medications.  His BUN/CREAT has shot up and he now refuses to eat ANYTHING.  His entire diet consists of water, pills and whatever vitamin paste I can force him to take.  My heart is breaking for him...  I can't do anything and feel helpless.

I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!\", 'Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it.

However, I just tossed a whole box.  Something has changed -- and not in a good way.  I had concerns last year and thought maybe the taste was \"off\" just on the one box.

It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned.  Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch.  Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid.Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that AMAZON continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product \"LaraBar\" by \"LaraBar\".  I suppose this is because people who generally buy raw food product are not usually the same people who support multinational food conglomerates like General Mills.

They're unattractive and a mess to eat because of this. They also don't have that characteristic Lindt \"snap\" of the shell; it's like one big, misshapen, sticky lump of chocolate instead of the usual truffle - again, I believe this indicates that they melted during storage.

Ferrets are carnivorous, requiring quality proteins and fats, and sugar and carbohydrates are exceptionally bad for ferrets and puts them at great risk for a condition called insulinoma. Before we knew about diet and insulinoma in ferrets, we treated our ferrets to these per the instructions on the package and never really read the ingredients, trusting that a company marketing a product for ferrets would know what is safe and healthy to feed them. At about 4-5 years of age, all of our ferrets began displaying some strange symptoms: wobbly gait, staring off into space, increased urination, and later lethargy, extreme weight loss, inability to stand or walk at all, glazed eyes, and eventually a slow, painful death after 1-2 months of symptoms. It was horrifying, and agonizing to watch and have veterinarians say there is nothing that can be done at this stage. After consulting with many veterinarians after multiple ferrets displayed these same symptoms, we were able to narrow down exactly what was going on: insulinoma, caused by supplementing our ferret's diets with treats containing sugar and grains. We beat ourselves up over having caused our ferrets to live shortened lives by 1-2+ years just because we wanted to spoil them. These treats contain sugar as the first ingredient, which ferrets cannot properly metabolize. PLEASE, read up on the condition called insulinoma in ferrets and its link to sugar and carbohydrates in their diet, and come to an educated decision on what to feed your ferrets.

On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine.

The monk fruit, the basis of this sweetener, can be used in high-heat cooking, which Stevia cannot.But, read the label before you decide that this product is for you, because monk fruit is not the only ingredient. In fact, it's the third ingredient of four:1.  Erythrytol -- it's a sugar alcohol that's 60 to 70 percent sweeter than sugar, which occurs naturally through the fermentation of fruits. Industrially, it's fermented with glucose and a yeast. Unlike other sugar alcohols, erythrytol is less likely to cause gastric side-effects (gas and diarrhea) and it does not effect blood sugar.2.  Sugar3.  Monk fruit -- this fruit is 150% sweeter than sugar. It's derived from luo han guo, which is a Chinese gourd family.4.  MolassesWhile the label says this is non-caloric, note there is one gram of carbohydrates listed on the label. That's four calories per teaspoon. That's less than the 15 calories per teaspoon of sugar and Nectress should not have the same effect as sugar on your blood glucose, but it's still got calories and if you consume a lot of Nectresse, it's going to add up.It's debatable whether Nectresse is natural, either. Sugar comes from beets, which have been genetically modified. Also, the molasses and sugar alcohol components are suspect.Nectresse comes in a small plastic container with two pop-ups on the lid: one for pouring and the other for spooning. It looks like granulated sugar, the only difference is a slight peachy cast which I am guessing is from the monk fruit or the molasses.So--after all this explanation--how does it taste? I added Nectresse to a couple of my favorite teas to see. My initial impression was sweet--actually, much sweeter than the Stevia, which has become my go-to sweetener. A teaspoon will definitely sweeten a cup that would normally take two.The issue is the after-taste. It's sweet and sticky and it lingers. I rinsed my mouth out twice before that taste left.No thanks, I'm sticking with Stevia.Rebecca Kyle, October 2012', 'Ordered this product along with the Large Kong Wobbler Red toy for our 3 dogs (weight in at 45 to 65 lbs each).

When it comes to food, be careful what you buy on the internet.\", 'from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word \"Agave\" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as \"diabetic friendly\". What's not to like?As it turns out, quite a lot.Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.\"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,\" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. \"Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses\", she told me. \"Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK\".Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.', \"It sounded like a great idea for a Halloween party, but I can't really say if these are any good or not.

The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  \"Forbidden rice?\"There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.What is sold as \"forbidden rice\" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf.', \"This smells more like cat food.

Purchased in February of 2012.We have an extremely picky cat with health issues who will eat nothing but Whiskas Seafood pouches (not even the other Whiskas pouches). We've purchased this food from a number of different sources but noticed that it cost 50-70% less on Amazon, so we ordered a large quantity. Right as we started feeding our cat the food purchased on Amazon, he suddenly started leaving large amounts of food (which we had to throw away) and losing weight rapidly. We did not initially associate this with the food, and assumed it was a health issue, but could find no evidence of any problem. It was as if the cat suddenly had gone off his food.Fast forward three weeks or so: We've been feeding our cat Amazon's Whiskas, throwing away half of what he leaves in the bowl, and are still having no luck trying different types of food. Suddenly it occurs to me that his new 'health problem' started when we began giving him the Whiskas pouches from Amazon. So I examine the pouches, and here is what I find:- The packaging is in every way identical.- The consistency is much thinner. Where the gravy is thick and clings to the package in Whiskas pouches from Safeway/Petsmart/Petco, the gravy is watery in the Amazon version. This is best described as: The Amazon stuff immediately pours from the package, whereas the stuff from other stores has to be squeezed out and sticks to the side of the pouch.- The expiration dates on Amazon's pouches differs from the date on Amazon's boxes. The expiration dates on Safeway/Petsmart/Petco boxes is consistent: the same on the pouch as on its box.- Both Amazon and other food had an expiration date that was Jan/Feb/March of 2013, so nothing was expired and they were supposedly all manufactured around the same time.- Amazon's cat food is mysteriously WAY cheaper than even Petsmart. 50% cheaper. That is a suspiciously huge price difference for a 'grocery store item', even for Amazon's great prices.So I go to the store, get some more of Safeway's Whiskas Seafood pouches. As soon as I put it in the cat's bowl, he hungrily starts biting into it, as if he hasn't eaten in weeks. (and he barely has!) We finish the box of Safeway Whiskas pouches, and before contacting Amazon, I decide to switch back to the remaining Amazon pouches to see what happens: The cat doesn't eat it. Will not touch it. He won't even lick the gravy off of it, which is normally the first thing he does. I gave him the food this morning, and he hasn't eaten a bite. I let the other cats into his feeding room (they're on dry food but will eat his wet food when they get a chance), and not one of them touches the food.After the food has sat there completely untouched for about 10 hours, I go to amazon.com to initiate a return. Turns out you're not allowed to return this kind of consumable! However, knowing Amazon's history of being an exceptionally fair and honest company, I contacted customer service, and explained the problem to them. They immediately processed a refund, with full apologies, no need to return the item. (I'm throwing it away)So thank you Amazon for your outstanding customer service. I greatly appreciate it and will remain a frequent Amazon customer as I have been for 15 years. I've asked your customer service rep to open an investigation to find out if this cat food is counterfeit. I will apparently receive a report about the investigation.In the meantime I recommend to customers that you do not order the Whiskas Pouches through this page (maybe a different provider through Amazon would be fine). You may risk feeding your animals counterfeit (possibly harmful) food.\", \"I have been giving my senior dog these pill pockets for about two years now.  Up until recently they've been great.  However, they seem to have changed the formula and now she hates them.  I have to shove them down her throat and often get bit in the process.

So disappointing.\", 'This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.', 'This is a very tasty tea, but you should be very careful if you are early in your pregnancy (or potential pregnancy).

My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs.\" Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.', \"This has to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever had in a k-cup.

However, since then I've discovered that Westbrae uses cans with BPA in the lining.With BPA lining the cans and research showing solid levels of the chemical leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams (from infants to the elderly), I don't think the product can still be called organic!BPA leeching into our food is no better or safer than products sprayed with pesticides.At least pesticides can be washed off many foods (not all, but some). Most people, though, just empty cans of foods, like beans and tomatoes, directly into their recipes without thinking of washing them first. (How does one rinse or wash soup?) In fact, many people like the salt and other seasonings in canned foods. They believe it is safe to use the foods as they are in the can, which is a reasonable assumption since that is how such products are marketed.I know I quit adding salt to my own recipes containing canned foods many years ago, because the canned goods already had salt in them. The canning process is supposed to kill bacteria and preserve nutrition, just as home canning does. It wasn't until the information came out about BPA in our bloodstreams, and from where most of us are exposed to it, that I realized there was a problem using such foods as is. There are still many Americans who do not yet realize that there is a problem and they are unwittingly feeding that problem to their families.There is something especially unethical and tragic about people paying a company higher prices for organic foods, thinking they are better protecting their health, only to be swallowing BPA with each mouthful.Until Westbrae stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks for either context.\", 'This is for the regular flavor...I give it zero starts, it was so bad.Hard to believe this is food, and really hard to believe all of the good reviews.

She then ripped into the legs and removed two squeakers in less than an hour.Note my dog has done damage to all toys except the classic kong and bounzer ball.

The poor puppy got very sick after eating a Greenie. He vomited and had diarrhea.I took him to urgent care and the Vet's verdict(informed on the X-ray)was: \"a Greenie got stocked in his intestine\".I was very lucky to get the puppy recovered with medicine. But surgery was being considered by the Vet (mind about $7,000). On the worst case scenario, my puppy could have died because his intestinal system was obstructed for 3-4 days.After this unfortunate incident, I looked-up for reviews about this unsafe product -and not to be surprised- I found several concerning stories like mine. I also learned that few dog owners have sued Greenies because they believe it was the reason that provoked an obstruction to their pets digestive system, sadly resulting on death. \"Roughly 315 million Greenies were sold last year, but the breath-freshening treats have been blamed for at least 13 pet deaths and more than two dozen complaints have been filed with the Feds\". Dogster-comNote that as the product label says: Greenies are not 100% digestible, and if you read with more attention, the label has a Warning saying that: dogs may get sick or even chock when ingesting a Greenie!At the end of the day, it's hard to believe that there are companies like Grennies that don't address these issues, and just care about marketing and profiting -not so much about producing a healthy, safe treat for our best buddies.In any case, I'd recommend to ask your Vet or read more dog owners reviews before giving Greenies to your dog.', \"This was one of the worst soups I've tasted.

I called Garden of Eatin' and was told that there was new analysis and testing done which shows they only actually have one gram of fiber per serving. That's a huge difference!

Maybe they think that people can't tell the difference between peanuts and macadamia nuts?I would have given these bars two stars since they actually taste OK, but I have a hard time believing that the 4.5 star rating the product currently receives hasn't been created by company shills.It is a shame too, since the cranberry almond bars I also ordered were excellent and actually tasted like the description.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this.

Now, I greatly regret my cavalier attitude about this particular item.  Had my Golden been weakened in any other way, I do not believe he would have survived this incident.  My on-going purchase of this product despite prior bad press and numerous complaints was foolish.  But I trusted that the distributors of the dried chicken \"breasts\" would monitor this product more closely after the first recall of this product so that no other animals would be harmed.  Such was clearly not the case.  In fact, it appears that the only action the U.S. distributors took after the last recall was to print on each package that the product had come from the United States.  Closer inspection however reveals that although this product was packaged in the U.S., it continued to be imported from China.  Amazon is by far the best retailer on the Internet by far.  My complaint is not against Amazon.  But I feel compelled to alert other potential customers regarding the poisoning my dog suffered (and he did suffer).  I can imagine other pets who are smaller, older, or in some other way more vulnerable than my Golden, would and could actually die if they consumed even the smallest amount of this product.  It's true that this was not the case every month.  Rather it is an intermittent but on-going problem.  I cannot emphasize enough how serious this problem is.  It is absolutely necessary to eliminate the distribution of this product in the U.S. once and for all.

It's like buying peanut butter - you get what you pay for. I think the problem I have with it is that it doesn't taste like it's made from fresh almonds. It tastes stale or on the verge of being rancid. It could be the oil used or the almonds I have no idea. I just bought it and tasted it without letting it sit around for awhile. I like to spread it on apple slices for a healthy snack. I wanted to like it but after having other brands I loved, I will not ever purchase this brand again. If you are picky about peanut butter then you might be picky about almond butter too.

Couldn't be happier, it is as described - bold, delicious, loved it.BUT I bought this several times and each time I had problems with my Keurig and the packaging.

Keurig would say \"prime\" repeatedly after using these cups, and I would have to go through the extensive method of re-priming my Keurig.  I bought this twice, and (yes, I'm slow), with the second batch realized the problem was the packaging of the K cups.  For whatever reason this kept happening.Since I cannot return this item I am stuck with 30 of these that I won't use.I also won't order anything with the blue cups again, especially not this brand.Just to clarify - I am not a serially negative poster, and I have had my Keurig for over 6 months.

WRONG!!!', \"I ordered some xylitol and erythritol products from this company and found some of them had a very, very strange, foul smell. Kinda like mothballs. They get some of their products made in China (the erythritol, apparently), so I called the company with my concerns, worried about possible contamination. I waited politely while the receptionist asked the CEO if I could have a refund just for the strange smelling items (even though it is listed on the web site as refundable). She came back and said, yeah, they'd take it back this once, but they would never accept another order from me again. Next she started to chastise me for ordering more than one of the same thing since I'd never ordered from them before. (Note: I only wanted a refund for the unopened bags of the item in question. I did not ask to return anything else in the order.)I explained that I had ordered it before from another company, but she interrupted me to say that I should test one item from each new company before assuming the items are the same. Well, in chemistry class we've learned that pure chemical substances should be the same, and it says as much on their own web site. While I was pointing this out, she hung up on me.I had ordered a wide variety of this companies products - xylitol, erythritol, candies, gums, etc. Some were ok, but the ones that had the bad smell had me worried. I was very surprised when they did not want to stand behind their product guarantee and told me not to order again when I was only returning the items that seemed to be defective.NOW foods offers the same items that I have ordered and they smell and taste just as sweet as sugar. They are also available here on Amazon.com.Try them instead -- I am sticking with them from now on.----------------------------------I ordered a wide variety of things, including this item: erythritol, xylitol, gum, candy, etc. It included this item and a lot of other things.-I asked only for money back on items I tried that were suspect as being defective, and then only for the items I had not opened.-I asked the manufacturer if the items were safe to consume, given the very odd odor some of them emitted.-My review concerns primarily the customer service problems I had, as well as the concern with the origin of their products I had ordered in general.Personally I think it is odd that when I called to return a small part of a rather large order that the customer service rep did not want to honor the guaranteed refund posted on the web site. She literally chastised me for asking to return the items since I had ordered several of the same thing. How was I to know the substance would smell so badly? She said I should have just ordered one. What difference does it make since I had only opened one? The others were perfectly sealed. She said she would take them back after much ado, and then said they would never accept another order from me. (Like I would anyway after that).I stand by my post. If you have had a good encounter with their customer service, I am happy for you. That was not my experience. They should not post a guaranteed refund when they don't mean it.\", \"I couldn't even taste the chocolate. It tasted more like dirt that was brewed with hot water.

Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has \"vegetarian spices\" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion.

I actually thought I was receiving all six since Activate has many more than six flavors.  I thought THAT is what \"variety\" meant.  I received three bottles each of four different flavors.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.', \"Have used the sugar-free Hazelnut syrup for a couple years now.

There is no way to make this product any worse unless it makes your break out into a rash or poisons you. The \"protection\" and I use that term loosely, that this deodorant gives is minimal.

It's horrendous. When you apply this deodorant your nose will slightly burn and your eyes will almost water. It's hilarious that their commercials revolve around attracting the opposite sex, when the smell of this would send any female running. I'm not joking when I say this but, I'd rather smell like body odor than smell like AXE deodorant.

You can pay $3.75 for each container and figure it out.', 'Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as High Fructose Corn Syrup!!!!Based on the labeling, I could picture native peoples creating their own agave nectar from the wild agave plants. Surely, this was a traditional food, eaten for thousands of years. Sadly, it is not.Native Mexican peoples do make a sort of sweetener out of the agave plant. It's called miel de agave, and it's made by boiling the agave sap for a couple of hours. Think of it as the Mexican version of authentic Canadian maple syrup.But this is not what agave nectar is. According to one popular agave nectar manufacturer, \"Agave nectar is a newly created sweetener, having been developed in the 1990s.\" In a recent article now posted on the Weston A. Price foundation's website, Ramiel Nagel and Sally Fallon Morell write,Agave \"nectar\" is not made from the sap of the yucca or agave plant but from the starch of the giant pineapple-like, root bulb. The principal constituent of the agave root is starch, similar to the starch in corn or rice, and a complex carbohydrate called inulin, which is made up of chains of fructose molecules.Technically a highly indigestible fiber, inulin, which does not taste sweet, comprises about half of the carbohydrate content of agave.The process by which agave glucose and inulin are converted into \"nectar\" is similar to the process by which corn starch is converted into HFCS. The agave starch is subject to an enzymatic and chemical process that converts the starch into a fructose-rich syrup--anywhere from 70 percent fructose and higher according to the agave nectar chemical profiles posted on agave nectar websites.\"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing,\" said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. \"Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses\", she told me. \"Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK\".Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.If you simply must have some sweets, a small amount of agave nectar every once in a while isn't going to kill you. Just don't buy into the idea that it's any better for you than plain old sugar or HFCS.Info is taken from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.So please.

If you take 20 chunks out of a bulk bag, you will see that there are 4-5 different kinds of meats there.  some wil be moist and chewy, others will be nothing but rubber, some with thick tendons running through, and some are quite marbled.  Just when you find a piece to your liking - you are back searching for a lucky chunk again.  smaller bags, especially teriyaki is very greasy and has so much coating that you taste all the chemicals way before you get to meat flavor ( if you can call it that).i'd give this jerky a 2 if there was meat consistency, but its a total crap shoot.  you can find LOTS of other - better tasting jerky in the same price range, here on amazon.  even the middle of the road obertos is much better than this stuff.

I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since.

My grandson speaks his mind eloquently and succintly.  Upon the arrival of my order of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNHQ34\">Funfresh Foods Real Food Trading Company Himalayan Pink Sea Salt, 2-Pound</a>, I quietly served it at a family meal.  Almost instantly my grandson asked who put sand in the salt.  I smiled, chuckled and told him no one had put anything in the salt and that this was special pink salt from half way around the world.  \"It has sand in it, Grandpa! I don't like it!\" he replied.  Nay, nay, not so, I assured him (and everyone).  \"Let me show you.\"I drew a small glass of filtered water and added a liberal amount of the pink salt.  (BTW, if you like the C.Cola bottled water, *asani, much of it comes from the same source in FL as my tap water)  So I swirled the pink salt around in the water.  Let me mention that I have a degree in science and a bunch, like a lot, of chemistry courses so I know that table salt, sodium chloride (NaCl) is really really soluble in water.  Well, after much stirring I got quite a bit of pink insoluble grains on the bottom of the glass and, most disturbing, the liquid was cloudy!  I've been watching it for a couple of hours now and nothing is settling out.  I'll keep watching, but what the cloudy water means is there is either a fine particulate that will settle out in time or there is something else in the \"salt\" that is not or not completely water soluble or is colloidal, which does not make me feel good about this product.It is my understanding that most table salt is produced by crystallizing the salt from a saline solution, either natural (sea water) or man made.  The difference between \"regular\" table salt (at least in the US) and Kosher salt is that regular salt is allowed to crystallize undisturbed and will form cubical crystals while Kosher salt must be raked during the entire crystallizing process, thus forming the light flaky crystals familiar to that form.This product, it appears to me, is a mined mineral that contains a high NaCl content that is not further refined.  It is finely ground perhaps in the hope that end users will not notice that it also contains rock, sand, or whatever makes up the Himalayas.  The product claims to contain less Sodium (Na) and that may well be true, but is that lower Sodium content because it has ground rocks/sand in it?I'm returning this because it is an inferior product that is not what it is advertised to be.  This might be fine for a live stock salt lick but it is not fit for human consumption!Many Hours Later:  The cloudiness is clearing, so my conclusion is that it was caused by very small particles that took longer to fall out of suspension.

These estimates are based on the replacement of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, however, trans fats in partially hydrogenated oils would most commonly be replaced with unhydrogenated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have additional potential benefits as compared with carbohydrates. If such additional potential benefit is considered, greater proportions of CHD events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted.\"Note that the disproportionate percentage of heart disease attributable to trans-fat is astonishing, since the authors point on on the first page that trans-fat makes up only a tiny proportion of the american diet:\"The average consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.\"They conclude\"On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimental studies, dietary trials, and prospective observational studies, the consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides no apparent nutritional benefit and has considerable potential for harm.\"Professor Willett (one of the co-authors of the above article) is the chairman of Harvard's nutrition department, the author of the medical school textbook \"nutritional epidemiology\", and the most-cited author in his field.

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it.

However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.

We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the \"customer service representative\" if you can call her that, simply said \"if you don't like it then don't buy it.\" And then she hung up on me.The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any \"stickers\" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.

I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.', 'The stated shipping weight says eight pounds so I thought this was a bulk order.

So my question is \"What Happened?\" Not only was it one package but all six. If this is their new product,they lost a customer.But if it was a bad batch, I say how dare they send this out to consumers,take their money,and think its right.Today there are many treats made that she can eat,but I stuck with Newmans out of loyalty,because they were first in making a great product Bella could eat.And Bella really loves this treats.I hope Newmans can fix this.', 'The only directions for use that came with this product, if they can be called that (which I submit they cannot), read as follows: \"1. Cleanse 2. Smooth 3. Soothe 4. Seal.\"Huh?I was clueless, so I called the 800 number at the bottom of the ingredients list, got connected to Customer Service and asked how I was supposed to go about using their product. The rep told me to massage the product into my scalp right AFTER shampooing, while my hair was still wet, then to \"pull it through\" my hair with my fingers and the result would be not only a healthier scalp, but also shinier hair. What I got was a head of hair that could have easily won auditions for revivals of \"Grease,\"  \"Jersey Boys\" and maybe even \"West Side Story.\" Good thing I tried this on a day when I didn't have to be seen in public, as it took four very thorough shampooings  before there was any way I was going to be able to take my head out of the house that day.

I loved these because they are cheaper than the CET brand, and neither of my cats had any trouble eating them.  Why the single star then?  Well, because I can no longer give them to my cats in good conscience.  They just recently changed the formula to include eucalyptus oil, which is toxic to cats.  And it's listed not once, but twice.  I have an elderly cat who has chronic renal failure, and there is no way I am giving her anything that is even the tiniest bit toxic.  Maybe if I had 2 young cats I would be less concerned, but as it stands, there is no way I will buy these treats again unless they change the formula back.  I still have the packages from the last order I bought, and there is no eucalyptus oil anywhere in the ingredients.  I have no idea what they were thinking when they added a well known toxin to their formula, but I will be buying the CET treats from now on.\", 'I am surprised (NOT) that they will not list the ingredients of the spices on any of their products.

Who in the hell is giving this product five and four star reviews?!?!?!  This is absolutely disgusting.', 'I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a \"fair shake\", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a \"bad batch\" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat \"favorites\" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into \"fish broth\", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on \"fish water\" doesn't sound like a good deal to me.', 'All good except the product. More minute and very small chips than slices. Price was good but these were obviously rejects at the factory. I will not buy them again.', 'The pink lemonade gum balls were not flavored pink lemonade.

The almonds were shipped in a way too small bubble envelope mailer.  When they arrived, the envelope was ripped open and about half of the almonds were unusable because they were broken and crushed during shipping.  Terrible packaging job!  Suck it up and use a real box.  I know it costs more but it almost destroyed this order (ruined half actually).  I'm a small business owner and want to keep costs down too but this was just unacceptable.As for the quality of the almonds that survived: they were ok.  Not terrible, but I found the ones we ordered through nuts.com to be better (thinner candy coating, larger almonds, fresher taste).  Yes, they're more expensive but after not being able to use a good portion of this order, it may be worth it.

Also, the poultry by-product meal ingredient just grosses me out.The $9.99 price for 4.5 pounds might also be cost-prohibitive for most dog owners.

However, after only 2 pills (separated by 8 hours), one of my dogs (8 month old puppy) became violently ill about 2 hours after the 2nd pill pocket with numerous episodes of explosive diarrhea and vomiting (ultimately very bloody after 12 hours). It ended up costing us money for a vet visit and medicine to get the dog to get well, and a major scare that the puppy was going to die (could hardly move after 18 hrs of this). The medicine was not new, nor any thing else changed, so I presume it was due to these (certainly not going to try them again to see). Our other dog (adult) did fine, however. Maybe it should just not be used for puppies, or maybe it's just an unusual reaction, but if you google \"pill pockets diarrhea\", you will see this is an occasional known side effect.Would suggest trying just one of these (or half of one) each of the first few days to make sure your pet is not intolerant of these. 1 out of 2 for me was not good odds.', 'I can still remember Captain Midnight sitting there in the uniform of an astronaut of the 50's (khaki shirt and black four-in-hand tie) telling me solemnly that I should drink my Ovaltine because it tasted good and it was good for me.

Furious stirring with a metal tool called a spoon didn't do it, nor did trying to grind them up against the side of the cup.  Even using a tenderizer tool didn't work as I soon discovered that as you pushed it down the cup, the warm milk came up and out. You had to compromise by trying to round up the little critters on the spoon and that offered little comfort as the crunchy buggers didn't taste all that great anyway. To top it off, all you had left was warm milk.The jar of Ovaltine was also very resilient. It lasted a long time in our home. It was the same one.

In the quest for a healthier sweetener, I decided to purchase a small box of Truvia, thinking that the powdered form might be more inviting.  Instead, it has the same disgusting bitter aftertaste that I remember from Sweet n Low. But like that sweetener, many people seem to enjoy Truvia and other Stevia products.

There is just enough cherry juice in there to give it a hint of cherry behind the apple and grape flavors.  For a cherry lover like myself, this drink was a disappointment.  Further, I think this drink is tremendously overpriced, considering it is just a little over 8 ounces of mostly apple and grape juice with some carbonation added.  If you can do without the carbonation, buy yourself some apple juice or grape juice.  It is much cheaper ounce per ounce.

Ummmmm\", 'I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I \"transitioned\" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of \"transitioning\" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real.', 'I actually feel awful giving a bad review to a product manufactured by a company that might be a small, independent operation, but... dang, these are bad.  I checked the label before purchasing them b/c while I am all for the idea of organic, I did not want some crazy gluten-free, vegan, tasteless, saw dust biscuit.  These were neither gluten-free nor vegan, passing the test with real ingredients like whole eggs, flour and real chocolate.  I figured I was in for a treat.  WRONG.  Unfortunately, they are dry (even though they're \"soft baked\"), and flavorless.  They have that very specific, cardboard, non-flavor that you get with weirdo hippie-food.

The taste is redolent of corn puffs, with a hint of Multi-grain Cheerios.  Too much honey on the front end, with corn notes that are slightly overpowering in the finish.  The bouquet has distinct peanut notes which is unsurprising as peanuts (which actually aren't a nut) are the main nut in the cereal.  Somehow this combines however, into a cereal that is at once both, overly sweet and mealy.I would also add that the price, $30 + $8 shipping comes out to about .88 an ounce.  Compare that to major grocery chains and other cereals, such as Crunchy Nut Roasted O's at .38/oz, or Honey nut cheerios at .28/oz, and its clear that these are horribly overpriced.Also, when it says nuts (and I realize I'm being a stickler), I really expect it to contain treenuts, like almonds, cashews, etc.  Peanuts are a legume, a groundnut, and technically a bean.

The same rep (female) who responded to my complaint in  Dec 2011 took my call today, but not knowing I had called before, she kept insisting there has never been a complaint about rancid bits before. I told her I called in Dec and she said \"someone else likely helped you\". Not wanting to argue, I moved on, but she clearly lied to me so I thought I should update about this. I was asked to include a note this time, to say where purchased but that has nothing to do with the fact that the company thinks it's \"acceptable\" that some fat is getting thru via processing. Fat cannot be freeze-dried so it will turn rancid even if freeze dried - read my original review and see how this was answered the 1st time I called last year...Very disappointing that the company doesn't care to hold the processing plant's feet to the fire about fat getting in, but then to lie to a customer is not good. But they will honor their satisfaction guarantee! So the only way to get this issue resolved is for all of us to get refunds. All you need to do is send the proof of purchase and your invoice to the address on the bag, along with your name & address. I find that about half of the bags are rancid. Dogs don't care, but cats won't eat rancid anything so very expensive if issue is ignored. Pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund. Companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit. I hate to do this, but my cats beg for these and I'm going broke replacing rancid bags!ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought two 6.2 oz bags of PureBites Chicken for dogs, first trying out a small cat size pouch found at PetSmart, and then moved up to the dog-sized bags/chunks, which I crumble with my fingers to get them smaller for my cats, who love this product BUT both of these bags purchased on Amazon had rancid chunks that smushed into slimy/greasy mush when I crumbled them.The company admits this happens, said it's part of the processing, nothing can be done, but it's not acceptable, and they will refund once I send proof of purchases & invoice to them.So it's hit or miss, and the company agrees...so just an FYI to warn others to check their bags!For those feeding this to dogs, and not breaking up the chunks like I do, please take note of this and check on the chunks before feeding. You can also detect a faint rancid odor if there are rancid bits in your bags.The reason for the rancid chunks, according to the company is that pieces of fatty chicken do get in, and fat doesn't freeze-dry, so without preservatives, it will go rancid. I knew that, but had hoped they could offer a promise to correct this; they can't and have no intention to do so. So I'll keep buying and hoping I get good bags, but will certainly take the time to get refunded whenever this occurs.The product is excellent when you get a good bag..just check each piece before feeding, or if you have a good nose for rancid odors, take a whiff and you'll smell the slight rancid odor, and can return the product.', 'When I received this order, the outside of the box was wet from the leaking contents inside.

They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the \"voluntary\" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through \"other\" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM.

If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is \"this is NOT chai tea.\"  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called \"spicy clove tea.\"  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a \"traditional\" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it \"healthy,\" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.', 'The product is fine, but the cost is exorbitant.  It cost 5.99 at a store in Florida and I paid about 18.99 per jar.

My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.\", \"THERE AREN'T ANY CANDY SEEDS ON THE WATERMELON TAFFY.

She also developed urinary problems.

The staff at Weruva would not talk to her or answer her questions and I couldn't guess why that would be unless their research has no real scientific backing to indicate this is a nutritious food. I tried calling them about week after that to see if they would tell me anything -- I got the same dismissive response. Pet food is not regulated and these smaller manufacturers can get one vet to review their ingredients and pay them off to say - 'hey this is a great, human-grade, grain free food'.

Why she got fat and lazy and was always panting, but never too satiated to turn up her nose at Science Diet.  She was always begging for it, every 4 hours.  And her litter-box smells, and the size of the poos--I swear, they were human-size!  I thought okay, she's a growing kitten, she must know more than I do about her nutritional needs, so I kept filling the bowl.  But she got so huge so fast that I knew something was wrong.So I did my research and learned all about sub-standard pet food, and what cats really need. It's not Science Diet, that's for sure!  Yet our local pound where I adopted Tiki insisted on keeping her on Science Diet, because \"it's good for the cats and they love it\". Hmmm.I began weaning our Tiki off Science Diet about 2 months ago.  It has been a long and tortuous change for both of us.  I have to put up with pitiful meowing all hours of the night.  Unfortunately I have to keep a small bag of Science Diet in the pantry (long story short: our other emaciated cat Tonga needs to have a small amount of Science Diet mixed in with her good Evo food to \"fatten her up\" with empty calories).You should see Tiki when she comes anywhere near the Science Diet bag of food.  She goes nuts, literally.  She yanks at the bag, tries to rip it open, drags it around the house in her teeth...one time she even bit through some plastic water bottles to try to get behind them and attack the Science Diet.When we began this process 2 months ago I switched to Innova Evo (timed feeding) along with various expensive wet foods, freely fed.  Evo is great for the cats (though Tonga, already a sleek looking cheetah-wannabee) lost weight on it; hence, the need to augment her food with fattening, empty-cal Science Diet.  On strictly Evo and wet food  our Tiki, too, has lost weight, but it has been gradual, as I can't do it too fast, because she is still a growing kitten at 10 months.Sorry for the jumble of writing, but you get the point: NO to Science Diet.', 'I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.

I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great.However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula.

The product description did not disclose the fact that it is fake coffee.  If a real cup of freshly brewed coffee is what you want from your Keurig brewer, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!\", 'Go to [...].  Search for the video entitled:  WHOLE FOODS MARKET \"ORGANIC\" FOOD MADE IN CHINA!!!!According to my research, China is the major supplier of Goji berries.  There's been an unresolved growing concern about food, any food produced in China, even though it is labeled \"organic\" with the USDA and AIC labels.If you want to know about specific products, you can go to the WJLA website for a \"do not purchase\" list.Because I learned that China produces the vast majority of the world's supply of goji berries, I sent an inquiry to a US distributor-retailer of \"certified organic\" goji berries to ask them how they knew for sure that their \"certified organic\" goji berries were truly organic.  I never got a response.I have learned that the Chinese government does not allow non-Chinese, independent individuals or agencies to inspect the organic farms in China.  I do not know whether the Chinese government has changed that policy or if any progress is being made as of this writing.Until I can be sure the higher prices for \"organic\" labeled foods are justified, I am going to avoid any food products that are \"Made In China\" from Whole Foods Market or from any other distributor.If you don't see the country of origin on the label, my feeling is....why?  And I don't buy it.Of course, even if the label says \"Made In USA\", that is no guarantee that some ingredients in the product do not originate in China.  E.G., Trader Joe's does not sell products \"Made In China\" but that does not mean that products put together and \"Made In USA\" do not use ingredients imported from China.  Which is worrisome.The consumer is king.  If you weigh in with your buying habits (your almighty wallet), the producers will listen.  Your health is the most important asset you own.

Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them.

Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the dog food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat.  i would recommend going to [...] and compare brands and see what is right for you budget wise. try something like orijen or evo.\", 'We purchased a case of this so-called \"natural\" coconut water, took one sip, poured the remainder of that first bottle down the drain and returned the case for a refund.

I suppose it is possible that my Grandma was a better cook than yours.  These are awful preserves.  And that is the nicest thing I can say about them.The packaging is spectacular, the quality, the flavor and the overall experience eating these preserves is way below par.  I did consume some, just hoping my initial experience was not good.  These preserves are terrible.  These are the worst tasting fig preserves I have ever tasted.  I was so excited reading they are just like Grandma's; I got the cherry flavored one too.  Yikes.Side-by-side, you could not tell the difference in the two jars.  They tasted identical.  The fig did not taste anything like figs and the cherry did not taste anything like cherries.They tasted identical.  They tasted awful.I am very disappointed especially since after reading the other reviewers; I was really excited to have finally found some good fig preserves.\", \"Awful tasting coffee... should have known better that the price was too good to be true.

The Bags were damaged - cuts in them - but there was no damage to the box they came in - so, of course, I got stale walnuts.', \"These berries are just gross. When I opened the bag, the odor turned me off immediately. Also, they aren't just dry, but rather like small stones. They made me think of the stuff you put in the bottom of fish tanks. Again, not something I was looking forward to eating.Their texture is again very dry. They feel like small pebbles in my hand. After tossing them into my mouth, and crunching a bit, they are very juicy. I'm not sure if I like the flavor because I'm thrown off by the nasty after taste, like grain. I don't know if you've ever smelled rabbit food or grain for horses. (I grew up with horses.) This is what the stuff smells like to me. Moreover, I imagine had I tried grain, it would taste like that: grain and berries. Gross.I got the pack of two so I could give a pouch to my sister-in-law for Christmas. I hope she likes the berries. Perhaps they would be better in smoothies, but I'm reluctant to try.If they didn't have the funky after taste, I'd like them better. Oh, and the smell. Gross.\", \"These peanuts are of low quality. I found myself throwing away more than I ate. About one out of five were even edible. Most are brown or black and if you eat one of those it is the nastiest thing you will ever taste.

I do hope this was an error and not deliberately deceptive packaging.  Please reply.Kenneth K. Rose', \"I tried this tea as my introduction to Rooibos.  I was very excited after hearing of the benefits of rooibos.  To my dissapointment I thought this tea was disgusting! Luckily, I didn't give up and tried other brands (Numi and Yogi are great) of rooibos and they were all fantastic.  This tea has a stale vanilla taste that completely covers up the natural flavor of rooibos.  Stay away from this tea.  Plain rooibos without added flavors is perfect on it's own.\", 'I had heard wonderful things about these noodles, and with the low-cal \"included,\" thought I'd give them a shot.  They were AWFUL!  I rinsed them several times, but they still had a fishy smell.  They also did NOT absorb the flavor of the sauce I cooked them in, as I had read they would do.  Ate about 3 forkfuls, then threw the rest in the trash.', 'Every one of the bars have a white fuzzy mold on them. It is disgusting!Fortunately, I received a refund; without having to go through the hassle of having to package them up and send them back.', \"My kids and I love root beer and I brew my own from time to time. Recently while purchasing some specialty versions from a local store I saw the Jack Blacks Red Dead Root Beer and thought the label was cool so I grabbed a couple. After we sampled it, all I can say is don't waste your time. It has little to no root beer flavor,it finishes a little spicy in fact. It has caffine added which was a bit of a put off as well. I was very disappointed with the flavor of this product. If you want a pick me up and you don't mind it tasting like sugar water mixed with dish soap then this is the drink for you.\", \"What a waste of money.

It was still warm but I could not wait to taste it, I absolutely love Apricot juice but, to my dismay this tasted like Pear juice. So I refrigerated it and when it cooled I tasted it again, again, Pear juice is all I could taste. I looked at the list of ingrediates to my surprise it read Pear juice first and Apricot puree next.  The puree I believe was supossedly for the color as it is not Apricot in color but very light orange. When ordered, it stated \"100% Apricot juice\", what I received was \"100% Fruit Juice Blend\" under that Apricot. To me this is very misleading as you can see by the picture it  states \"100% Apricot Juice\" and NOT \"100% Fruit Juice Blend\" which by the way tastes like \"Pear juice\".Save your money on this product and do more research first. Terrible, unless you like 'Pear Juice\" which I do, but not when I expected \"100% Apricot Juice\".', 'The selection of K-Cups was not as pictured.  Out of 34 cups, I received 13 vanilla and 6 hazelnut.  Only 4 cups were not a Green Mountain Coffee product.  I ordered the sampler pack specifically so that I could try different flavors from a variety of producers.  To say that I was dissapointed is an understatement.  Clearly this product was a collection of \"leftovers.\" It come packaged in a stapled brown paper bag.

Although the bottles said Frosty, they all had generic gold caps and the 'root beer' was VERY light in color.  When opened the beverages were flat and had no carbonation.  I only purchased from Amazon because the local Rural King only sold individual bottles and they were to be a gift.  Will have to go back to Rural King and buy 12 to put in the shipping box these came in, as they are a 'non returnable' item.  Do not recommend and will not buy again.\", \"Agree with some of the negative reviewers in that it tastes a lot like the packaged, instant hot cocoa mixes.  I use Cadbury's or even Safeway brand cocoa mix and boil the milk and all that - but as I do have a Keurig machine (actually Cuisinart now - Keurig brand did not last a year!) wanted to try this since it's at my grocery store.It's very sweet.  It seems to be creamier than the packet versions (no lumps of powder) but it is definitely sweet - and as much as I like sweet this was just too much.  Maybe as other reviewers have stated it is because it is made with a sweetener rather than sugar.So - no I wouldn't recommend this at all if you expect 'chocolaty' because you do get a 'sugary/strange sweetener' taste.\", 'I am so sorry I did not listen to the other reviewer.  These gumballs are tinier than anything I have ever seen sold in a package like this.  It takes about 6 of them to equal the size of one regularly-sized gumball.  I have posted a picture so you can see how small these gumballs really are.  The package clearly states \"25 cents\".  The fact that the Amazon reseller is charging nearly double that price is shameful.']\n"
